It didn't matter that I felt like a fool 'cause I forgot when she walked through the door.
I believe that in matters of the heart there is no such thing as compromise. Love means that you give each other everything.
There was no doubt he loved her. Had always loved her. Now with God's help he might be able to love her better.
Each kiss was nearer to the last one of all.
The moon & sun were just friends til that night the sun couldn’t depart before dark snowed in under an avalanche of stars & poetry was born.
I wasn’t seeking a place, but a person. I’d come home.
On a hill we rest, Watching virtue Hold the heavens.
Moonlight bounces tears across the tops of trees, switch blade shadows at our throats, where life’s lacerations approach for romance.
Who knew such belongings? That the truest love Could blend The margins of life Into forgotten wants.
He didn’t want to see inside Lily’s heart; he didn’t want to know her beauty was the least remarkable thing about her.
he'd asked her. And her life had changed.
With you I could live, without you I was already dead.
When the sun has been destroyed for a man, what comfort is there in a world of moonlight?
Why should he worry himself about this woman? And why should he worry about anything else as long as he had this woman?
Oh, how glorious it must be, to care nothing for society’s censure, but how terrible it must be, to care for nothing at all.
I finally let someone else in and now the weight of what happened to me isn’t so heavy to carry around.
I can bear to die - I cannot bear to leave her.
He doesn’t hug back. But he doesn’t pull away, either. Yeah, we’re improving.
I love you, Killian O’Brien. Every inch of you from your thick brown hair to your large warrior’s feet, and a good many inches in between.
Life is not easy my friends But you need to actually decide What u want to leave as it is And what u want to hold tight
You slept with twelve women in one day? Wow, that’s really impressive! And without Viagra!” the other man lowly declared to himself.
No I don't love you. A part of me just dies whenever you go faraway from me.
I’m a man again, and a man works.
Now I know what he’s been hiding under these three-piece suits
Music takes you halfway there. The story takes you the rest of the way
Now, listen. I would. Rather. Hug you. Than be with. Anyone else. Just. Hug you. Do you. Want to. Hug me. Back.
You show me an angel that breaks bad, and I’ll show you a devil in disguise.
Why can't I find someone who loves being with me, as is, as much as I love being with them?
It is the first thing I remember about him, and I can hear it still today. Later!
I'm on edge, sunshine. Give me a moment to clam down. Maybe after I've had you a few times I'll be better.
I’ve seen too much of what the spotlight can do to a person to ever crave it for myself.
I have a feeling you two are going to tag team against me all the time, aren't you?
If it doesn't hurt then it's not love
I don't know what it is about this man that makes me melt into a puddle.
This time, when I look into his eyes, I see a gleam of mischief.
Your little ladybug tried to seduce me with a cookie.
Lord help the girl he set those eyes on for good. His boyish vulnerability was a weapon, powerful and disarming.
You deserve to be the love of someone's life, not the one who followed that first act.
I create entire romances in my dreams.
She was his favorite sin. She was not a habit for him anymore, she was an obsession.
I want to be the first thing you touch in the morning and the last thing you taste at night.
Arthur might be a king, but he can’t make you come.
He grinned against her lips. “Slow down before you tear off a part we both need.
I’m working on my application for knighthood. But if you want something less chivalrous and more carnal, let me know.
The best time of a relationship is when your eyes speak when silence says everything Expressions are the beak

What is it about you that makes me want to love you?
Art is the word we give to our feelings made public and art doesn't worry anyone
Okay, let me unwrap my present. Open those gorgeous legs. I want to devour my gift.
He's all man. I bet he would look amazing in one of those gladiator costumes.
That's exactly what it would be to fall in love with him again; pure trouble and a twice broken heart.
Her heart was stupid. Her mind? Now that was something she could actually count on.
She was like a drug and he was letting her get back in his system just by standing there with her.
She was the most dangerous person to him when it came to avoiding attachments, trust and love.
There are of course, girls and girls; yet at heart they are pretty much alike.
In age, naturally, they differ wildly.
But this is a thorny subject.
Suffice it to say that all men love all girls the maid of sweet sixteen equally with the maid of untold age.
There is something exasperatingly something or otherish about girls.
And they know it which makes them more something or otherish still: there is no other word for it.
A girl is a complicated thing.
It is made up of clothes, smiles, a pompadour, things of which space and prudence forbid the enumeration here.
These things by themselves do not constitute a girl which is obvious; nor is any one girl without these things which is not too obvious.
Where the things end and the girl begins many men have tried to find out.
Many girls would like to be men except on occasions.
At least so they say, but perhaps this is just a part of their something or otherishness.
Why they should want to be men, men cannot conceive.
Men pale before them, grow hot and cold before them, run before them (and after them), swear by them (and at them), and a bit of a chit of a thing in short skirts and lisle thread stockings will twist able bodied males round her little finger.
It is an open secret that girls are fonder of men than they are of one another which is very lucky for the men.
Girls differ; and the same girl is different at different times.
When she is by herself, she is one thing.
When she is with other girls she is another thing.
When she is with a lot of men, she is a third sort of thing.
When she is with a man.
But this baffled even Agur the son of Jakeh.
As a rule, a man prefers a girl by herself.
This is natural.
And yet is said that you cannot have too much of a good thing.
If this were true, a bevy of girls would be the height of happiness.
Yet some men would sooner face the bulls of Bashan.
Some foolish men probably poets have sought for and asserted the existence of the ideal girl.
This is sheer nonsense: there is no such thing.
And if there were, she could not compare with the real girl, the girl of flesh and blood which (as some one ought to have said) are excellent things in woman.
Other men, equally foolish, have regarded girls as playthings.
I wish these men had tried to play with them.
They would have found that they were playing with fire and brimstone.
Yet the veriest spit fire can be wondrous sweet.
Sweet? Yes.
On the whole a girl is the sweetest thing known or knowable.
On the 6 whole of this terrestrial sphere Nature has produced nothing more adorable than the high spirited high bred girl.
Of this she is quite aware to our cost (I speak as a man).
The consequence is, her price has gone up, and man has to pay high and pay all sorts of things ices, sweets, champagne, drives, church goings, and sometimes spot cash.
Men are always wishing they knew all about girls.
It is a precious good thing that they don't.
Not that this is in any way disparaging to the girls.
The fact is A girl is an infinite puzzle, and it is this puzzle, that, among other things, tickles the men, and rouses their curiosity.
What a man doesn't know about a girl would fill a Saratoga trunk; what her does know about her would go into her work box.
The littlest girl is a little women.
No boy knows this and precious few grown up men.
Thus Many a grown up man plays with a girl, then finds himself in love with her.
As to the girl Always the girl knows whether the play is leading: she probably chooses the game.
Very late in life does a man learn the truth (and significance) of that ancient proverb that Kissing goes by Favour.
For The masculine mind is the slave of Law and Justice: Aphrodite never heard of Law or Justice: she was born at sea.
That is to say, Few are the men who at some time in their lives have not wondered at the vagaries of girlish complaisance: the foolish, the ne'er do well, the bully, the careless, the cruel, it is to these often that a girls' caress is given.
And, Curiously enough, that is, curiously enough as it seems to purblind law loving man, should the favored one be openly convicted, that alters not one whit his statue with the girl; for, A girl, having given her heart, never recalls it not wholly: she may regret; she never recoils.
In other words, To the man of her own free lawless choice a girl is always loyal; to subsequent and subordinate attachments she is dutiful.
So, Even the renegade, if loved by a girl, will be upheld by that girl through thick and thin secretly, it may be, for often the girl, nevertheless devotedly, and only under compulsion will he listen to the detractor: he may desert her, or, if he sticks to her, he may beat her; no matter: he holds her heart in the hollow of his hand.
But, But, Few things mystify poor law abiding man than this, that the central, the profoundest, the most portentous puzzle of the universe the weal of woe of two high aspiring, much enduring, youthful human souls, should be the sport of what seems to him the veriest and merest chance.
The unconscious search of sweet sixteen is for (in mathematical language which will not sophisticate her) the integral of love.
Yet In the short years between sixteen and twenty a girl's love will undergo rapid and startling developments.
A girl with lots of brothers has more chances of matrimony than a girl with none: she knows more of men; especially of their weaknesses and idiosyncrasies.
And To know the weaknesses and idiosyncrasies of men is perhaps a wife's chief task; unless it be to put up with them.
Often enough the freckled and fringrant girl wins over the professional beauty.
Sometimes grown up girls are just as shy as little ones and for the same reasons because there is no one who knows how to play with them.
Girls often play with love as if it were one of the amusements of life; but a day comes when love proves itself the most sensuous thing on earth.
And A girl is quick to discover the kind of love that is required of her.
As a rule Many a girl who has been sore put to it to prove herself whole hearted.
For of course, Always every suitor expects whole heartedness.
And this every girl instinctively knows.
Indeed, Is not a half hearted love, or a half hearted acceptress of love, a contradiction in terms? A certain measure of the sophisticated or unsophistication of a youthful damsel may be found in her manner o f receiving the attentions of a stranger in a station different from her own.
Young women, themselves but rarely unsophisticated, view with a certain pitying sort of curiosity unsophisticatedness in men.
And A young man's unsophisticatedeness it is a great delight to a woman to eradicate.
Yet A girl regards with complex emotions the man who has blossomed under the genial warmth of her rays; the flattery to own powers is counterbalanced by the evidence of lack of power in him.
A girl thinks she detects flippancy in seriousness.
A woman thinks she detects seriousness in flippancy.
What would be conduct decidedly risqué in a city miss, is often innocent playfulness in a country maid.
Between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, girls play with love as if it were a doll; very soon after twenty they discover it is a dynamo.
This is why An early and clandestine engagement often works more havoc than happiness.
For Either, one of the parties to the concealed compact receives or pays attention which perturb the other; or, a subsequent and acknowledged lover looks askance at the previous entanglement.
Since even if A clandestine engagement (as is usually the case) is merely a flirtation with the emoluments which accompany a promise to marry, those emoluments are not nice things for a subsequent and avowed lover, whether masculine or feminine, to think upon.
Lastly, A laxity with regard to the claims of courtship is apt to breed a laxity with regard to the claims of wedlock.
In short, Flirtations, like clandestine engagements, are an affront to love.
Accordingly To the engagement ring should be as attached as much importance as to the wedding ring.
Indeed, A difficult and a delicate path it is that a girl has to tread through life and often enough a dangerous.
Yet with extraordinary deftness she treads it.
She must win her a mate, yet has to pretend that the mate wins her.
She makes believe to be captured, yet has herself to be intent on the chase.
To be wooed and wedded is the law of her being, yet not for one moment dares she to exhibit too great an alacrity to obey that law; for she knows instinctively that an easy victory prognosticates a fickle victor.
Is she abundantly endowed with the very attributes that make for wife and mother hood, a strong and swaying passion and an affection unbounded, she must hold them in leash with exemplary patience; for, alas! Are they given the rein for a single passing moment, instead of being accounted unto her for righteousness, they work her ruin.
She must win her one man, and she must win him for life; but she cannot pick or choose, for she must wait to be asked.
If she make test of many admirers, she is described as a flirt; if, conscientious and demure, she await her fate, a desirable fate is by no means assured.
In truth it seems that too often a girl must dissemble hateful as dissemblance in men.
T'is a hard road indeed that a girl has to travel.
To win her a fellow farer for life, she must go out of her way to accommodate so many travelers: and this one is lured by this, and that one by that, and another by something unnoticed by the throng.
But, an she dissembles one iota too much, her fellow farers look askance, and he who eventually joins her for good upbraids her for that by which she won.
Dissemblance is indeed at once the boon and the bane of a girl: without it, she thinks to be overlooked (often enough a preposterous assumption); with it, she is looked upon too much.
And always, Always a girl has to pretend that never did she descend to dissemblance.
Which, nevertheless, is sometimes absolutely true, for Just now and then there happens that miracle of miracles, where their flames up in the man, and their flames up in the maid, in both at once, unaided and unlooked for, that divine and supra mundane spark which smolders lambent in every youthful breast: when maid and man take mutual fire at touch of hands and look of eyes, fire lit at that vestal altar which knows no source and burns for aye.
For man, the over grown boy, life has commonly two, and only two, sides: work, and play.
Happy he who has for a helpmate one who possesses the faculty of increasing a zeal for the first and of adding a zest to the second.
Wherein, O woman, thou mayest happily find the two fold secret of thy life work.
For Man is a greedy animal: he wants all or nothing.
And fortunately for him, Women tacitly extol man's greed: they will not be shared any more than they will share.
There is something canine in the masculine nature: like a dog over a bone, it snarls at the very approach of a rival.
It is curious, but it is true, that proud man becomes prouder (and more curious still at the same time humbler) when weak woman gives him something a look a smile, a locket, her hair, a kiss, herself.
The greater a man's faith in himself, the greater his mistress hers in him.
And perhaps, the greater his mistress her faith in a man, the greater his in himself.
For A woman's faith in a man works wonders.
A man to whom a woman cannot look up, she cannot love.
Yet, It is marvelous how a woman contrives to find something to look up to in a man.
Many men forget the artistic tendency of the feminine temperament, a tendency which shows itself in many ways their love of pretty things, of pretty ways, and of pretty words.
From which three alone we may deduce the rule that When with the woman he admires and whose admiration he seeks, a man cannot be too careful of his dress, his speech, and his manners.
A believer in Woman is a believer in Good.
And vice versa, and mutatis mutandis.
Man's standard of value of a woman is usually determined by the scale of his own emotions.
That is to say, The pedestal upon which a man places a woman (a man always puts a woman upon a pedestal) is a pedestal erected solely by the effect upon himself of her charms.
A man may boast himself invincible by men; never by woman.
The lady killer is always an object of attraction to ladies, even to those whom he makes no attempt to slay.
It may perhaps be a thing as unreasonable as certainly it is indisputable, that however much wild oats a man may himself sow, he invariably entertains a very peculiar objection to any woman near or dear to him entering upon this particular branch of agriculture.
He is a fool who does not bear himself before his lady love as a prince among men.
Some men are so gallant that they will never be outdone by the woman who encourages them.
But it often leads to strange embarrassments and entanglements.
Few things terrify a man more than the knowledge of a woman's ability to make her emotions when, if ever, he arrives at it.
That is a very silly man who thing she can play one woman off against another.
For In matters of emotional finesse the masculine instance is nowhere: it is blinded, befogged, befooled at every turn.
Heaven help the man who is dragged into a quarrel between two wrathful ladies! Three things there be nay, four which man can never be sure, how a greatsoever his acumen, his astuteness, or his zeal: a woman; a race horse; a patent; and the money market.
They defy both faith and fate; they should be the recreations not the resources of life; and he is a fool who stakes more than a portion of his substance on any one of them.
What a paltry thing, after all, is man, man uncomplemented by woman! Left to himself, he stagnates; linked with a woman, he rises or sinks.
A gentle touch stimulates him, a confiding heart makes of him a new creature.
Under the rays of feminine sympathy, he expands who else would remain inert.
Fame may allure him, friends encourage him, fortune cause him a momentary smile, but only woman makes him; and fame, friends, fortune, all are naught if there be not at his side a sharer of his weal.
A man will strive for fortune, strip himself for friends, scour the earth for fame; but were there no woman in the world to be won, not one of these things would he do.
From woman, who e're she be, there seems to emanate a potency ineffable to man, impalpable, invisible, divine.
It lies not in beauty or grace, not even in manner or mein; and it requires neither wiles nor artifice.
It is not the growth of long and intimate acquaintance, for often it acts spontaneously and at once; and neither the woman who possesses it nor the man who succumbs to it can give it a name.
For to say that it consists in the effluence or influence of personality or temperament, of affinity or passion, of sympathy or charm, is to say nothing save that we know not what it is.
All unknown to herself, it wraps its owner round with airs the which to breathe uplifts the spirit, and yet, may be, perturbs the heart, of man.
Even its effects are recondite and obscure.
It allures; but how it allures now man shall tell.
It impels; but to what, does not appear.
It rouses all manner of hopes, stirs sleeping ambition, and desires and aspirations unappeasable; but for what purport or to what end, none stays to inquire .
It incites; sometimes it enthralls.
It innervates; it exhaults.
Under its spell, reason is flung to the winds, and matters of great mundane moment are trivial and of no account: for it bewilders the wit and snatches the judgment of sane and rational men.
It is most powerful in youth; it is most powerful upon youth; yet some retain it till far on in years, and no age but feels its sway: a veiled and mysterious force; sometimes daemonical, often divine: at once the delight and the despair of man.
After all, The man who declares he understands women, declares his folly.
For, If woman were not such a mystery, she would not be such an attraction.
For again, What is known is ignored.
(But woman need have no cause for apprehension.) Besides, Men may be classified; women never.
This is why Generalizing in the case of women is useless; since Woman is a species of which every woman is a variety.
And every man must make up his mind to this, that Every woman is a study in herself.
However, If women were comprehensible to men, men and women would be friends, not lovers (But the race is safe).
The simple fact is that Womanliness is the supreme attraction, in however fair or however frail a personality it is embodied.
And The sacred function of all womanhood is to kindle in man the divine spark by means 30 of the mystic flame that burns ever in the vestal breast.
Every true woman's orbit is determined by two forces: Love and Duty.
Which is another way of saying that Women, like the lark, are true to the kindred points of heaven and home.
But, It is only when the two foci are coincident and identical that her orbit becomes the perfect circle and her home becomes her heaven.
A woman's heart is an unfathomable ocean: nothing ever filled it; no one ever plumbed it.
At the surface are glancing waves, or flying spume, or, it may be, raging billows; beneath are silent depths invisible to man.
A thousand streams flow into it in vain.
Towards varying coast lines it bears itself variously; here, placid and content; there, dashing furious.
But none ever stamped his marked upon its brim, and always it remains the refluent, reluctant sea.
Of it man knows only the waves that break or ripple at his feet.
It betrays no 31 secrets; it asks not to be understood.
Storm and calm but stir or still its surface, and what things it hides forever engulfed no one may learn.
Subtle, yet mighty; an eternal, and entrancing, mystery to man.
A man's heart is the enclosing shore; measurable, impressionable, definite, and overt; thinking to house that sea, shaping it, over looking it, and staying and governing its tides.
Yet changed by it, crumbling before it, yielding to it: at once its guardian and its slave.
Yet perhaps The placidest of seas is that which is wholly land locked.
* Women, apparently, were made for men; men for themselves.
Certainly Men seem to carry out this design of Nature, that they should be ministered to by women.
A woman asks a woman questions in order to discover something.
She asks a man questions in order to discover the man.
he last thing that a woman will risk is her personal appearance.
Which is saying a good deal, for A woman will risk an interview at an unseasonable hour, but not in an unseasonable frock.
Never, never take a woman au pied de la letter.
Women's rights are: to be loved.
Women's duties are: to love.
There is always something sovereign and monarchial about a woman: like a queen's, her wishes are her commands.
And In matrimony, woman's sovereignty is not abdicated.
By no means; it is only transformed from an absolute into a constitutional monarch : she acts then by and with the advice of her First Lord.
This is the ideal State.
Woman's true function, as a citizen, in this world is: to spur men on to high and noble action.
And this, quite unconsciously, she does.
Woman's true function, as a woman, in the world is: to evoke man's most fervid emotions, and at the same time to keep them at their highest level.
And this she also does perhaps not quite so unconsciously.
They err who call women illogical.
Feminine logic is inexorable.
But it proceeds per saltum.
It is man who has laboriously to reason step by step.
The most wayward woman craves control: To let a woman have her own way is interpreted by her as indifference.
And The surest way to fail to please a woman is to let her do what she pleases.
Woman is born to acting as the sparks fly upward.
And What a woman really is, nobody knows, least of all herself.
To see a woman as she really is, one must see her with her babe.
For It is curious, but it is true, that not even before the passionate and accepted lover to whom she has utterly devoted herself can a woman bare her heart as can she to her babe.
Perhaps we may go so far as to say that Motherhood always partially eclipses wife hood: When the child comes, the man stands aside.
For It is not within the capability of man to evoke or to develop the totality of woman.
There are feminine potentialities he is powerless to awake.
There is a portion of womanliness always hidden from him.
To her babe alone she opens the innermost recesses of her soul.
For him she wears no masks, affect no accent, plays no part.
Even her features take on a different and unique expression before the offspring of her womb.
Never is she more womanly, never so strong, never so quite, never so self contained, never so completely herself, and never so beautify when bending over her helpless infant son.
And naturally: for say what one will, Motherhood is the goal of womanhood.
And Howsoever she comes by it, a woman's burthen is always to her "That Holy Thing".
So No one knows what a woman is like till she is a mother.
In other words Motherhood reveals womanhood.
And, be it remembered, There be childless women both spinsters and wives who could mother mankind in their bosoms.
Such women wield great influence.
For Many a mere man there is has owed his all to a motherly woman.
Nor speech, not restore, nor expression of feature, nor all combined, will ever reveal the real feelings of a woman.
To unbosom herself is impossible to woman.
Do not expect it, for Definite and accurate utterance is not given to woman.
The chief business of woman is: first, to get married; second, to get others married.
It is difficult to say which have played the greater havoc among men: the women with too much conscience, or the woman with none.
When a woman repulses, beware.
When a woman beckons, be warier.
Woman are always prepared for emergencies.
With woman, tact and jealousy rarely go hand in hand; tact and spite never.
The only instance in which a woman's tact is apt to be at fault is in detraction of a woman whom she regards as her rival; The instance in which a woman's tact is seen as its best is in deploying the men who she knows are rivals for her hand.
And usually When a woman has more than one admirer, she not only deploys them, but tries to make them advance en echelon.
For Few things disconcert a woman more than a multiple and simultaneous attack delivered front a front.
But The way in which a woman will maneuver her attackers is marvelous.
They say a woman cannot argue.
Hear her explain an indiscretion! An independent woman is a contradiction in terms.
For Woman's chief want is to feel that she is wanted.
Therefore it is that With women, cruelty is more easily borne than coldness.
Indeed, It is astonishing how much downright cruelty a woman will stand from the man she loves or has loved.
On the other hand, Melancholy also attracts women.
Naturally, Women are made to soothe, to pity, to comfort, to delight.
Therefore it is that To see a strong man in a weak woman's arms is a sight which should arouse not our laughter, but our envy.
So it does.
Common Gender Let not the simpleton think a woman will sympathize with his simplicity: No woman is a simpleton.
What women admire is a subtle combination of forcefulness and gentleness.
If a woman has to choose between forcefulness and gentleness, always she will sacrifice the latter.
And It is astonishing to what lengths forcefulness can go without endangering a woman's admiration.
If it sweeps her off her feet.
well, In nothing does a woman so clearly exhibit the inherent femininity of her nature as in the delight with which, at the bottom of her heart, she recalls moments when she has been swept off her feet.
She may sigh over them; but Generally, a woman's sighs are by no means those of remorse.
A woman never brings pure reason to bear upon her actions; she acts by sentiment 40 and she judges her acts by sentiment.
This is why Even when a woman has deceived and betrayed, she does not regard herself culpable.
Always, she says to herself, she was driven to it, and therefore she is blameless.
Accordingly A penitent woman is rare: Even when a man, with his so called superior reason, thinks he has proved her wrong, at the bottom of her heart she knows herself right.
Many have been the discussions as to woman's most powerful weapon.
The simple fact is, she is armed cap a pie.
Indeed, Every woman is a sort of feminine Proteus, not only in the myriad shapes she assumes, but also in her amenability to nothing but superior force.
Women form, perhaps, where men are concerned, the single exception to the rule that in union there is strength.
One woman often enough is irrepressible; two (be the second her own mother) break the charm an association of women is the feeblest of forces.
Cf.
Cowper: They are all women, and they dart Like Porcupines, from every part.
Anacreontics All women are rivals.
And this they never forget.
Consequently Mistrust a truce between hostile ladies.
Amongst women, modesty is of infinitely more potent influence than is ability.
Yet To a woman's modesty ability is a wonderfully enhancing setting.
And Modesty is the most complex and the most varied of emotions.
Perhaps When modesty and frailty go hand in hand, there is no more delectable combination known to men; and Aphrodite has not the subtle charm of a Cynthia.
Perhaps this is why such A wondrous halo of romance hangs about the name of a Heloise, of a Marguerite, of a Marianna Alcoforado; of a Concetta of Afragola; of a Catalina; of Robert le Diable's Helena, of Isolde; of Lucia of Bologna, the enchantress of Ottaviano; of Francesca; of Guenevere; of the sweet seventeen year old novice of Andouillets, Margarita, the fille who was "rosy as the morn"; of the Beguine who nursed Captain Shandy; of the fille de chamber who walked along the Quai de Conti with Yorick; of Ameilia Viviani, the inspirer of Shelly's most ecstatic lyric; of Dryden's masque loving Lucretia.
For, after all, Is the star any the less starry to the rapt star gazer when he finds it to be a tremulous planet? Cynthia may have blushed in heaven; bit did the blush make her any less lovely to the Latmian? Only in the clear and unclouded pool is the star undimmed embosomed.
They say a woman is capricious.
But the consistency of woman's capriciousness is only exceeded by the capriciousness of man's consistency.
Man calls woman capricious simply because he is too stupid to comprehend the laws by which she is swayed.
Woman does not call man capricious.
The inference is obvious.
To women the profoundest mysteries of the universe give place to two things: a lover, and a baby.
But perhaps these are the profoundest mysteries of the universe.
How many women there be who, deeming themselves fitted to be the consorts of kings, yet comport themselves dutifully as the wives of wastrels! And indeed, Given beauty, cleverness, and grace, 44 there is no position to which a woman could not aspire; for Being Woman, she is ex officio Queen.
Speak to a woman disparagingly of her sex, she is up in arms.
Speak to her disparagingly of a member of her sex, well, she will not be up in arms.
The reason for her bellicosity in the former case is the fact that A woman always interprets abstract disparagement of her sex personally.
And she is perfectly right.
It is not only the woman who cannot be accounted quite as stainless as the stars that sometimes trade on their charms.
When a strong souled woman wholly and unreservedly loves, her love will go to lengths passing the comprehension of man.
For Women prefer an despot to a dependent.
It is marvelous to what a pitch of demureness features by nature that the most coquettish can be set.
(A Man's features are often a clue to his character; a woman's rarely.) So it comes about that The owner of a seraphic face is often owner of a temper satanic.
Nevertheless, Often enough a spice of diablerie in a woman at once enhances all her charms.
It is indeed fortunate for the men that so many women are unaware of the power of their charms.
A woman would much rather you lied to her concerning herself than that you told her something unpleasant to hear.
Some women seem to be envious of some men's familiarity with immorality.
It is by woman that a woman will be first suspected; and it is by a woman she will be last forgiven.
The last thing a woman will ask you for is: your esteem.
And yet Cast a slur upon a woman's character and you are considered indiscreet.
Cast a slur upon a woman's personal appearance, and you are considered culpable.
Fashion is a woman's sole law.
And The surest evidence of strong mindedness in woman is to fly in the fact of fashion.
Ridicule is woman's keenest weapon; it is the poisoned arrow in her quiver.
Well is it for the men that she never, or so rarely, has recourse to it.
A woman is quick to discern the quality of the admiration bestowed upon her.
No one, not even herself, knows what a woman will do next.
Doubtless this is trite.
But it is true as trite.
Yet men rarely find it out till late in life and forget it as soon as found out.
A woman can say more in a sigh than a man can say in a sermon.
Nothing piques a woman so much as indifference to her favors.
Indifference to her undiscovered passion she quite otherwise regards.
The woman knows the male heart probably better than does it itself.
She knows above all things, that to hold that heart she must never wholly satisfy it.
And many and multiform and marvelous are the ruses by which she accomplishes that end.
And yet, Women there are who firmly believe that, were they to try, they could enthrall any man beyond possibility of extrication.
And 48 so perhaps they could; but the achievement would require as much unscrupulousness as it would seductiveness.
The seductive and unscrupulous woman is hatred of women.
Under the gaze of a group of men whom she knows that her brilliancy dazzles, a woman, like the snow clad hearth, sparkles: Under the gaze of a man by whom she knows she is passionately desired, like the same earth under the lordly sun, she melts.
All women think they can cozen men: few women think they can cozen women.
The women who perturb men most are those who combine too effectively adorableness with desirableness.
As in nature, so in humanity, flight on the part of the lady is not always symbol of unwillingness of pursuit.
On the other hand Feminine audacity by no means betokens feminine immodesty.
Feminine obduracy is invincible by man.
Luckily, it is rare.
Men call women variable: did she not vary, men would tire.
This, women instinctively know.
Women rightly dislike and disgust variability in men.
For Women like best to be liked: to lead gives them but paltry and temporary pleasure.
(Though this they do not always instinctively know; or, if they do, they conceal their knowledge.) And Variability is incompatible with leadership.
How delicately a loving woman reproves! How defiantly an unloving! How many lonely women married and unmarried the world contains, only these lonely women know.
The feminine métier par excellence is: to allure.
And The subtle and elaborate means by which women will devise to intensify the lure, passes the comprehension o f men.
Yet In all ages, to make herself attractive was as right and proper for the woman as to make himself feared was for the man.
Besides, With women the art of attracting has long since become second nature.
Women are quick to recognize a rake.
For A rake always rouses curiosity, never aversion.
A worsted woman always, either silently or volubly, calls down a curse upon her successful rival.
And 't is a curse that too often fails.
Many women handicap other women; and they handicap them in multifarious ways.
Probably the one most frequently used is lavishness of favors.
The woman who is lavish of favors is hated of her stricter sisters.
But, before these, what an air of bravado she wears! As a rule, women are far better readers of character than are men.
A woman will often startle a man by her penetrating insight into character.
And Many a man has been put on his guard by female institution.
The fragilest woman will be ill content with suppressed embraces.
And The ablest bodied woman loves being petted.
Even A prude is a shy coquette.
The man who judges of a woman by her letters is a fool.
Her gesture will contain more matter than her journal.
Besides, The woman who could punctuate could reason.
The debut of a younger sister evokes mixed emotions.
The prayer uttered or unexpressed of many an undowered young woman is, May a moneyed man fall in love with me ! And she is not always over careful to add, And may I fall in love with that moneyed man! If the "New Woman" turns out to be a fitter companion for men than the old, no man will complain of her novelty.
Yet Men regard the advent of the New Woman rather askance.
Why? Because To judge from certain feminine utterances, the New Woman seems more inclined to aim at rivalry than at companionship with man.
However, there need be no fears as to the result, since Such is the mysterious potency of womanhood, that, whether new or old, woman will always lead man captive.
Besides As every new variety of fashion in dress seems becoming to women, so, it is probable, every variety of fashion in manners will become them also.
But probably The phrase the "New Woman" is not unlike the phrase the "New Chemistry": the materials are the same; what is new is the nomenclature.
A phrase (and not much more than a phrase) much in vogue in Europe and America in the last two decades of the nineteenth century of the area known as Christian.
A woman's peccadilloes are generally worse than a man's.
At all events they are more reprobated.
* Abashment intensifies a woman's love for him so making her abashed.
And There is a shame that is sweeter than joy.
(As There is a fear more tremulous than delight.) For Mastery is a woman's standard of man.
And There is an element of the freest and frankest savagery in the most refined and spiritual of women.
(How otherwise Can any one explain the extraordinary fable of Selene and Pan? And man? But that man was ever a savage.
It may be added that The defenselessness of woman is a conventional fiction: she can avert an attack by a look; she can terminate a siege by a taunt.
Though Browning tried.
See "Dramatic Idyls", "Pan and Luna" Solomon has objurgated the invincibly garrulous woman.
The invincibly taciturn woman is so rare as to have escaped objurgation.
Yet she too is a terror to men.
Every woman is suspicious and jealous of any woman that opens a man's eyes; even though she knows that Never was there a woman who could and would deliberately wholly enlighten a man.
And, yet, marvelous and curious amongst things curious and marvelous, will but a woman fling artifice to the winds, and look and act and say as great Nature prompts, wildly, willfully, wantonly, that woman will captivate as no feminine wiles will ever captivate.
If the man were worth it, many a woman would dispense with the marriage ceremony.
For Ah! Love love love, given love, what else is needed? (Unfortunately Love can never be sure of itself much less of anything else.
Accordingly The marriage contract is a device on the part of the community to provide for the preservation of the home: it makes the parties promise fidelity.) But Precious few are the men who are worth the risking.
Unfortunately, More women succumb to strength of will than to strength of character.
Neither, in general, are women overcurious to enquire whether the strength of character.
Neither, in general, are women over curious to enquire whether the strength of the masculine will makes for good or for evil.
So long as the masculine will overmaster the feminine, the feminine mind is satisfied.
Of course there are exceptions, but as a rule, Women whether young or old, married or single, strong minded or weak are never happier than when they can depend on a man.
Accordingly, The lover or the husband who is weaker than, and depends upon, the woman, will some day rue his weakness and dependence.
And yet, To see a strong male at her feet that is exquisite to the woman.
So exquisite that It is with difficulty that a woman refrains from exhibiting a man's servitude to others.
On the other hand, There is an element of intimidation in a resplendent woman.
And of this she is aware.
Hence perhaps her power.
A woman will attain her ends by adroit finesse, where a man would blunder into open hostility.
And It is well that man should blind his eyes to feminine wiles, since, Always a woman kindly pretends oblivion of masculine blunders.
The woman whose tastes and refinements are above her station, is in pitiable plight: she is too fastidious to espouse the men who would marry her; the men she would marry she rarely meets.
For, The only thing that, to love, is insupportable is vulgarity.
Since Love, romantic love, the efflorescence and bloom of life, is besmirched unless tenderly touched.
To generalize passes the wit of woman; but in penetration she is preternatural.
What fascinates a woman is the man who unwittingly attracts her against her will.
But such a man rouses a combination of emotions comprehensible only by women.
A woman's answer to an insuperable argument is: a look.
And a most cogent answer it is.
Indeed, Speech is a woman's least effective weapon; rarely if ever does she resort to it: In the affairs of life, as in the affairs of love, where men be concerned, it is upon her personality that she relies, not upon her speech whether written or uttered.
Her personal appearance is to a woman, what his personal honor is to a man: it must be immaculate; constant with the fashion of the hour; and strictly in accordance with her or his status in society.
Accordingly, Dress and demeanor these form the code of feminine ethics.
Even Deception on the part of a woman is merely diplomacy; Women deceive only be cause man is too blind to see.
That is to say, Since man in past ages has never allowed woman either freedom of action or frankness of speech, it is not to be expected of her that she should be all at once an adept in their use.
To her credit be it said that, Generally a woman deceives only n order to arouse or to retain the admiration of man.
For example, Many a woman has surreptitiously made love to the man and few are the men who have detected it.
Why this woman fascinates all who come within the sphere of their influence, and that women, does not, no earthly sage will ever know.
As well ask what makes one man a Napoleon, another a poltroon.
So, too, It is impossible for a woman to say 'I will be loved,' as it is for a man to say 'I will be obeyed.' Perhaps Love and Power are divine miracles.
(At the risk of treading on delicate ground, ground off which I shall be hooted by the modern woman, I venture to say that) The idea that a woman is the property of the man of her choice, rail as it as the woman may, has not yet been ousted from the feminine mind and heart.
Indeed, So firmly implanted in the feminine breast is the idea of the ownership of her by the man, that it is to the man who assumes and exercises ownership that she clings.
This is why A woman easily changes her allegiance; since, Allegiance, to a woman, means loyalty to the man who assumes and exercises ownership over her: Let a man who a fractional part of a second evince the shadow of a doubt of his proprietorship at once he undermines a woman's allegiance.
Consequently, It is folly for men to express amazement at the ease with which a woman will transfer herself and her affections.
A woman will transfer herself bodily over and over again, but only because the previous owner lightly esteemed, or weakly maintained, his ownership.
As a matter of fact In pristine days woman was, naturally and necessarily, the property, the chattel, of the man: marriage was not then a matrimonial syndicate of two: marriage meant that a woman sought a provider, a supporter, a defender; the man a mate for his delight, his comfort, and his solace, a keeper op is cave or hut, a mother and nurse for his heirs.
And provision, support, and defense, being, in pristine days, matters of strength, prowess, or cunning, naturally and necessarily pristine man 65 gained him and kept him a mate by strength, prowess, or cunning; he regarded that mate as his by right of force, not as a partner in a compact.
And The most complicated of modern communities has no whit altered the relationship of man to mate, conceal though it may the origin and history of marriage.
Finally, No woman at the bottom of her heart has any objection to being owned.
Indeed (though no woman would say it, a man may), Every woman at the bottom of her heart delights to be owned, and tacitly and secretly seeks the man who she thinks will glory in that ownership and keep his property safe not only from material harms, but from temptations to changes of ownership.
In which last little fact lies a curious truth.
Women like to be defended against themselves.
In this little matter men and women differ: That any other man should dare for one instant to covet or alienate that most precious of his possessions, his mate, nothing rouses to a higher pitch man's unappeasable wrath than this; Against the man so daring, a woman's wrath is never roused: rather she regards him as one having discernment, and his daring is a commendable compliment to herself.
In fine, and in short, Allegiance, to a man, on the part of a woman, means, in her eyes, loyalty to him who properly exercises the right of ownership.
In simple truth, A woman gives herself to a man: to the man who proves himself worthy the gift, she is true.
And this is why women, all women, even the New ones, love being petted and admired and made much of all their lives: this but proves the possession of the gift to be appreciated.
Besides, The male is the dominant animal not necessarily in his cave or his hut, by no means, but in the stress and struggle of life; and women tacitly (though never openly) look up to and admire this dominance, even when exercised over themselves; since THIS, in turn, proves the masterfulness, the worth, of the man; albeit sometimes they rebel against it if carried to far.
At least, Unless a man continues to exhibit his appreciation of the gift by word as well as by deed, the woman is apt to imagine that that appreciation is on the wane.
How women must laugh in their sleeves at the fact that one man may sue another in a court of law for "alienating his wife's affections"! The beginning, middle, and end of love is a sigh.
All things point to the infinite; and love more than all things else.
Love is the most antimonial of emotions: it worships, yet it will not stop at sacrilege; it will build about its object a temple of adoration, then desecrate the fane; it will give all, yet ruthlessly seize everything; it delights in pleasing, yet it sometimes wittingly wounds; its ineffable tenderness often merges into an inclemency extraordinary; symbol of universal duality, it is at once demonical and angelic.
Nothing stands still in this world, not even love: it must grow or it withers.
And, perhaps, That is the strongest love which surmounts the greatest number of obstacles.
Love to some is an intoxicant; to others an ailment.
To all it is a necessity.
As is one's character, so is one's love.
And Perhaps the deepest love is the quietest.
Love is as implacable as it is un appeasable.
Nay more, Love is merciless: as merciless to its votary as to its victim: For Love would slay rather than surrender; would for swear rather than forgo.
Some loves, like some fevers, render the patient immune at all events to that particular kind of contagion.
Many lovers are vaccinated in early youth.
Only love can comprehend and reciprocate love.
This is why, If, of two sensitive human souls, the one loves passionately and the other not at all, the other is unwittingly blind and deaf to love's clamors and claims: the one may ardently urge; the other but passively yields: Only the famished understand the pangs of the hungered.
Of a great and reciprocated love there is one and only one sign: the expression of the eyes.
Who that has seen it was ever deceived by its counterfeit? Did ever the same love light shine in the same eyes twice? The light of love in the eyes may take on a thousand forms: exultant jubilation, a trustful happiness; infinite appeasement, or promises untold; an adoration supreme, or a complex oblation; tenderness ineffable, or heroic resolves; implicit faith; unquestioning confidence; abounding pity; unabashed desire.
He who shall count the stars of heaven, shall enumerate the radiances of love.
There is no Art of Loving ; though, as Ovid says, love must be guided by art .
Yet, If love did not come by chance, it would never come at all.
Ovid wrote not Art of Loving ("Ars Amandi"); he wrote on the Amatorial Art ("Ars Amatoria").
"Arte regendus amor." "Ars Amatoria", I, 4.
To each of us himself is the centre of the visible universe.
But when love comes it alters this Ptolemaic theory.
Yet, It is a significant fact that love, which, more than any other thing in this world, is the great bringer together of hearts, begins its mysterious work as a separator and puter at a distance.
For When love first dawns in the breast of youth, it throws about its object a sacred aureole, which awes at the same time that it inspires the faithful worshipper.
Can only two walk abreast in the path of love? How many try to widen that strait and narrow way! Love raises everything to a higher plane; but nothing higher than the man or woman who is loved.
Is there anything about which love does not shed a halo? Indeed, Love is a sort of transfiguration.
And when on the mount, we can very truly say, "It is good for us to be here".
If there is any sublunary thing equal in value to the true love of a faithful woman, it has not yet entered into the heart of man to conceive.
True love makes all things loveable, except perhaps the chaperon.
Was there ever man or woman yet who was not bettered by a true love? True love is ever diffident and fearful of its own venturesomeness .
But this not every woman understands.
Too often the Phantasm of love and not the Verity wins the day .
Women who seek a real lover should beware the overbold one.
Cf.
"La volupte Nous rend hardis, l'amour nous rend timides." Voltaire, La Pucelle, Chant vi.
See Leopardi, "Storia del Genere Humano", where the Verities of Truth and Love and Justice never leave the throne of Jove, but their Phantasms are sent down amongst men.
To merge the THEE and the ME into one that is ever the attempt of love.
It is impossible.
Yet, perhaps They are happiest who can longest disbelieve in the impossibility of this amatorial fusion; for it may be that such Incredulity is favorable to romance.
Love is not exactly a sacrifice; it is an exchange.
The lover, indeed, gives his heart; he expects another in return.
Love is like life: no apparatus can manufacture it; kill it, and nothing in the heavens above or in the earth beneath or in the waters under the earth will resuscitate it.
How many a forlorn human wight has tried to resuscitate love! To such heights does love exalt the lover that he or she will live for days in the remembered delights of a look, a word, a gesture.
But One thing is impossible to love: love cannot create love; the intensest and most fervent love is powerless to evoke a scintillation of love.
Love may worship, it may adore, it may transfigure, it may exalt the object of its devotion to the skies; but it cannot cause that object to emit one ray of love in return.
Hate may be concealed; love never.
The greater the imaginative altitude of love, the lower the boiling point.
But Love cannot always be kept at high pressure.
The young think love is the winning post of life, the old know it is a turn in the course.
Nevertheless, it is a fateful turn.
In love, the imagination plays a very large part.
And this may be variously interpreted.
Thus, By man, love is regarded as a sort of sacred religion; by woman, as her every day morality.
The former is the more exhilarating; but the latter is more serviceable.
Indeed, Love and religion are very near akin: both inspire, and both elevate.
And If faith, hope, and charity are the basis of religion, there never was such as religion as love.
And Love is the only religion in which there have been no heretics.
Why? Because woman are at once its object and its priesthood.
Love, art, and religion are but different phases of the same emotion: awe, reverence, worship, and sacrifice in the presence of the supreme ideal.
Love knows no creed.
Nay more, Love acknowledges no deity but itself and accepts no sanctions but its own: it is autonomous.
And yet And yet, love sometimes feels constrained to offer a liturgical acquiescence to the rubric of Reason.
In short, Between the prelatical domination of Reason and the recusant Protestantism of Love there has ever been strife.
Or, in plain language, There are two codes of ethics: one that of the romantic heart; the other that of the practical head.
Who shall assimilate them? The heart, in its profoundest depths, feels that something is due to Reason; and Reason, in its highest flights, feels that something is due to the heart.
Is there a divine duplicity in the human soul? And yet, after all, All love seeks is: love.
Yet love little knows that In seeking love, love enters on an endless search.
Since Love is an endless effort to realize the Ideal.
For Love always beckons over insurmountable barriers to uninhabitable realms; promises insupportable possibilities; lures to an unimaginable goal.
Yet Love has a myriad counterfeits.
And Men and women interpret the word differently.
Even Different women interpret the word love differently.
Thus, To one woman, love is as the rising of the sun: it shines but once in her whole life day; it floods everything with its light; it brightens the world; it dazzles her.
To another woman, love is as the rising of a star: a fresh one may appear every hour of her life, and nor she nor her world is one whit affected by its rays.
Indeed, one would hardly err if he said that Many a woman really does not know whether she is "in love" or not.
She is sought that she perceives; but which of her seekers is worthiest, which most zealous, which merely takes her fancy, and which appeals to her heart on these matters she meditates long to the exasperation, of course, of the individual seeker.
Accordingly, Men, carried away by their own passionate impulse, detest calculation of the part of women: Since HE stakes his all on impulse in the matter of love, says man, why should woman stay to consider? Foolish man! he forgets that A woman always weighs a man's declaration of love and legitimately and naturally; perhaps legitimately because naturally; for, once again, What a woman stays to consider in the matter of love is, not the potency of the impulse of the moment, but the permanent efficacy of the emotion.
Therefore it is that Woman unwittingly obeys great Nature's laws.
Many imagine that love is a thing like a chemical element: with a fixed symbol 84 and a rigid atomic equivalent.
And so it may be; but, like the philosopher's stone, hitherto it has defied detection in its elemental form.
The fact is probably that Love may be compared to a substance that is never found free, and which not only combines in all sorts of relationships with all sorts of substances, but also, like many another chemical body, takes on the most varied forms, not only in these relationships, but also under varying pressures and temperatures.
Or perhaps it would be better to say that Love may be compared to a musical note: to the unthinking it is a simple sound; to the more experienced it is know to consist of endless and complicated harmonical vibrations; harmonizing with some, and making discord with other, notes by regular but unknown laws; differing according to the timbre of the emitter; reverberating under certain conditions; lost to the ear in others; and only responding to resonators vibrating synchronously with itself.
Lastly, There is a whole gamut of love.
Changing that simile, we may say that Love is not like the sun: a unit, and practically the same wherever seen; it is like light: all pervading, universally diffused, and reflected and refracted and absorbed in varying degrees and varying manners by various objects.
And Than a great and pure love, can anyone point to anything on earth greater and more purifying? The lesser luminary perturbs the tide of human passion; the greater light draws it upward none the less veritably because in tinted formless vapor.
This is symbolical of love.
It is the nascent thing that evokes the keenest emotions: the bud the babe dawn and the first beginnings of love.
So Love, like sun light, wears its most tender tints at dawn.
It still remains a mystery that, out of a townful of folk, two particular hearts should worry themselves into early graves because this one cannot get that other.
Yet It is almost enough to destroy one's faith in the uniqueness of love to see from how narrow a circle of acquaintances men and women choose their spouses.
Were Plato's two half souls separated by the diameter of the globe that were lamentable.
The man often argues that esteem will grow into passion.
The woman knows that the argument is utterly fallacious.
Yet Unless passion is guarded by esteem, as the calyx ensheaths the corolla, the former is prone to wither.
In youthful love, as in the enfolded bud, esteem and passion like calyx and corolla seem one and identical; It is only the full blown flower that displays its constituent parts.
Would that love could remain ever in bud! To some love comes like a flash; to others as the burning of tinder.
In all, when real love is kindled, it devours all that is combustible.
But All love, like all fire, needs, not only ventilation but replenishing: Unless the primal spark is nourished, it will not glow; Stifle love, and it dies down.
So Even the love of a married pair, unless it retains something of the romance of courtship, is apt to go out.
Love takes no though of surroundings: an empty compartment is as good as a coppice.
Give it privacy, it is satisfied.
In love, we would much rather give than take.
Yet, if the giving is one sided, there is trouble.
And Love brooks no half measures.
Again, Trust a woman to calculate the breaking strain of her lover's heart.
But she will never let him off with less than the maximum stress.
When love is dead, it is perhaps best soonest buried.
In astronomy, to determine the motions of three bodies mutually attractive is admittedly difficult.
It is easy compared with the same problem in love.
A man's work and a woman's love, though to each the sum total of life, are often things wholly and totally dissociated.
Man, the egoist, thinks that if the woman loves him, by consequence she will love his work.
It may be, but usually, non sequitur; for Few are the women who can understand a man's work: For thousands of years man has worked in the hunting field, in the market place in the camp; for an equal length of time woman has worked by the cradle, by the hearth.
Accordingly, Man has two sides to his nature, woman but one: Man wears one aspect when facing the world; he wears quite another aspect when facing women; At their work, men are rigid, frigid, austere, sever, peremptory, tyrannical, downright; With women, .
.Humph! Wherefore, O strenuous and high aspiring man, in thy work, seek not from woman's love what woman's love cannot give; but set thy face 90 as a flint.
Bethink thee of the fate of Anthony.
For Man's chief business in the world is: Work.
Woman's chief business in the world is; Love.
Man's love (perhaps just because it is his play thing, not his business) is more finely tempered than is woman's, and takes on a finer edge.
For this very reason it is the more easily turned, and is the less useful.
It is the pocket knife, not the lancet, that is oftener called into requisition.
Also, Man's love is usually a highly ephemeral affair.
With a man, love is like hunger or thirst: he makes a great fuss over it; he forgets when it is appeased.
Yet When "passion's trance" is overpast, it is fortunate if affection takes its place.
So too, In love it is the man who protests; and That man is fortunate, who, after marriage, has not some dubious reflections as to whether he has protested over much.
For In love, it is the man, generally, who makes a fool of himself.
Love (like murder) will out.
But Jill keeps her secret better than Jack.
For A woman generally controls love: a man is controlled by it.
And Jill's very power of making believe to be "fancy free" exasperates Jack.
It is a purely feminine ruse to apply a test to love both her own and that of her lover to prove it true.
A man would as soon as think of applying a match to a powder magazine to prove it combustible.
Love in woman's eyes is the supreme and ultimate arbitrator.
If she is loved, love in her eyes will condone anything anything.
For To prefer honor to love is a maxim to women unknown.
With them love IS honor.
And therefore the maxim is meaningless and needless.
It is a sort of legal or rather charitable fiction that women should surrender only to love.
In fact, Do not even the lightest of Laises and Thaises make a show of being swayed by love? And No woman by too much love was ever spoiled.
Man, remember that! The logic of the emotions differs from the logic of the intellect.
As to the senses Alack a day! The senses never reason.
Love sometimes wrecks its barque upon the rocks to prove that they harbor no mirage.
Love sometimes forgets that it is possible to probe too far.
Love, in pursuit of love, sometimes vivisects as unconsciously as a science in pursuit of life.
Women detect the dawn of love while it is still midnight with a man.
That is to say, A woman knows a man is in love with her long before he is aware of it himself.
Except perhaps in this once circumstance: when she herself is in love with somebody else.
And this is a highly important circumstance.
Wholly to satisfy masculine infatuation is given to no woman.
And perhaps Wholly to satisfy feminine caprice is given to no man.
So, sometimes, The last refuge of an unrequited love is the belief that love will create love.
Nothing can be more futile than such a faith.
Yet Love without hope, has its mitigations; but How alleviate the pain of a love that mistook a simulated love for a true one? A simulated love is a contradiction in terms.
Either one loves or one does not, that is the conclusion of the whole matter.
Love would rather suffer than forget.
Love would give the world to be able to exculpate a languid lover.
A passionate love is perhaps always poignant.
Love disdains pity.
A wounded love carries a scar to the grave.
In love, when honor is lost, loss of shame soon follows.
Then indeed the downward patch becomes precipitous.
To some, love never comes; to some, it comes too often; but the same love never recurs, as never a bud opens twice: happy he or she is who gains bud, blossom, and fruit.
Since The sweetest love is that wherein the odorous flower of passion ripens into the nourishing fruitage of affection.
But Love requires careful nature.
And The more exotic the love, the more difficult its culture.
True, An orchid may life on air.
Yes; but how torrid and vaporous an air! Your sturdy mistletoe thrives on the humble apple; a Cattleya requires a Columbian forest.
Youth wonders at the amatory successes of middle age.
Youth knows not that In matters amatory, age is no handicap: A girl in her 'teens will make love to a gentleman of forty and vice versa.
In fact The indiscreet impetuosity of youth succumbs before the astuteness of age.
The bachelor and the spinster both sometimes wonder that the benedick and the bride are still their rivals; for they know not that In the amatorial art, matrimony is no handicap.
In short, There is no barrier at which love will balk.
Nay more, Love will forgive anything: Did love demand it, love, though it might blush, would not blench.
And Often love itself stands amazed at its own divine audacity.
Indeed, Love loves to immolate itself for love.
Knowing that To love, nothing is common or unclean: for Love, like charity, thinketh no evil.
But remember that It is only the Uranian Aphrodite that dares essay a divine audacity.
Nevertheless, Love is the most vulnerable of the emotions, and A love doubtful of itself would be cautiously accepted: it is not a fact that To try to feel one's own pulse, is to make the heart beat irregularly? So, To try to see in a mirror the love light in one's own eyes, is to be dim it.
So, too, If passion is not linked with affection woe worth the day when the troth was plighted! But given passion linked with affection ah! Nothing, nothing is criminal to love; for love knows not conscience.
Or rather, Love upsets all conventional conditions.
For Love creates a world of its own, a world populated by two and these make their own laws or make none.
So A woman will imbrue her hands with blood, and a man will fling honor to the winds, and yet the twain regard each other as impeccant and impeccable.
Till Pippa passes; then, Love always awakes to the fact that not even a community of two can live without law; and that Though human laws may be outraged, those divine may not.
And assuredly, The ideal love is the divine love.
And, in ideal love, Strange, strange, but true, in a great and ardent love, when at last that is offered which was long sought, there supervenes upon the lovers a great tenderness, which hesitates to make their own that for which they yearned.
Almost it were as if A psychic monitor warned the conqueror to be clement, and the captive to be kind.
This Tenderness is the worship of the soul by the soul.
And Of all tests of love tenderness is the truest.
But indeed, indeed In love there are heights above heights, depths beneath depths: who shall scale them, who shall plumb? See Plato, "Symposium", 180 et seq.
Lovers think the world was made for them.
And so perhaps it was.
To each other, lovers are the most interesting personages alive; but onlookers regard them partly with amusement, partly with pity, partly with compassion in the etymological sense of that word.
The first wonder of every accepted lover is that he should be the accepted lover of such a woman.
What the woman thinks .
what the woman thinks, probably not even she herself knows.
Probably each woman thinks her own thoughts.
To doubt whether one is in love is to prove oneself out of it.
To impress upon the lover the still existing necessity of refining gold or painting the lily is out of the question.
Yet every woman attempts it.
If there is one proverb more distasteful than another to a hot headed lover, it is that half a loaf is better than no bread.
* Children, dogs, and old people are difficult to deceive.
Lovers who have to use circumspection should remember this.
A doubting lover should mark how, and for whom, his woman dresses.
To die for a woman would perhaps, to a young and ardent lover, not be difficult; to wage incessant warfare with the world for her, that perhaps is not so easy.
But it is the better test of love; and perhaps also the better preserver and replenisher of love.
For Little as people seem to be aware of it, love requires constant replenishing: no flame can burn without a feeding oil, no pool overflow with out a purling brook.
Yet The first ecstasies of love often blind both lover and lass to the care necessary for the nurture of love.
Indeed, To many treat love as if it were a passing whim; whereas in sober reality it is (or should be) a lasting emotion.
Love, with woman, is like the tides.
And Few women know the high water mark of their love: they are always harboring the belief that it may rise still higher; and often they await that rise.
It is but the reflection of himself in his mistress that many a foolish lover loves.
That aged spinster is a rare one who does not regret she did not accept one of her lovers.
But That younger spinster is not to be envied who has to make choice of several.
Youth glories in the multiplicity of its lovers; age sometimes wishes it had had but one.
The unloved think lad the one thing needful.
The beloved know that an ocean of love could be swallowed up and the parched soul cry out athirst.
It is not well either to confide or confess too much.
A very small rock will wreck a very big ship, and a very small slip will spoil a very long life.
The pain which lovers cause each other through fickleness, languidness, jealousy, and the thousand natural shocks that love is heir to is not altogether pain, though at the moment it may seem the most poignant anguish the human soul could suffer.
One proof of this lies in the fact that There are few who would choose to have missed love's pangs altogether.
Perhaps the pleasure intermixed with love's pangs arises from the thought that the other is the cause of our suffering.
For, In all love, it is the sacrifice of oneself for the other that brings keenest joy.
And yet There is an element of self love in the very extremest of love.
Since Love, after all, is a debtor and creditor affair.
(Who ever loved with no hope of return?) It is when one of the parties declares him or her self insolvent that the account is closed with many tears and sighs on the part of the chief creditor.
At all events The intenser the love, the more flawless does its object appear.
For The surest test of the sincerity of love is that it thinketh no evil.
The surest test of a waning love is that it begins not to content itself when it sees its object suffer.
The surest test of a dead love is that it forgets how to be jealous.
The falling out of lovers true is a renewing may be of love.
Still it is not to be recommended.
In fact, it might be said that Every falling out of lovers true is a nail in love's coffin.
Yet, A blessing it is that in love we remember the sweet rather than the bitter.
For Love was ever bitter sweet .
"Amanitum irae amoris integratis est." Terrence, Andria, III, 23.
But I supposed innumerable people have said this before.
No matter.
The heart of a lover is like that bottom of a well: all the beauties of the starry heavens are revealed in it; but when it sheds the light of its countenance upon it, all else is obliterated.
Was any lover ever loved enough? Or Did any ever hear of a tired lover? Nevertheless often "Drink to me only with thine eyes", says the youthful lover; but when the seance is over he goes out and orders beef steak and bottled beer.
What it really craves, the lover's heart is impotent to express.
Yet, it is ever attempting.
A lover is full of wishes as an egg is full of meat.
But What it really wishes no lover seems able to say.
As a matter of fact, The endless task which the lover is ever attempting is a search for a formula for the summation of an infinite series of which love is the variable.
Few lovers seem to understand this.
To kindle aspiration in her lover, a woman herself need not be aspiring.
For, Whatever the talents of a man, they are stimulated by contact with woman.
Since An elevating influence seems to radiate from women: we have but to come into the light of their countenances for our own faces to shine as the sun.
Indeed, Physicists may talk as they like, but lovers know a more subtle and a more potent force than any yet revealed to them.
It has not yet been named; but for the present it might be called "psychicity".
Dr.
Oliver Wendell Holmes speaks of "celebricity".
See "Over the Tea Cup" If you wish to ascertain the relationship of a youthful pair, watch their eyes.
For Simulation is difficult to the eye.
When the idol into which a woman has converted her lover is dethroned, she still worships her remembrance of her god, and puts together and treasures the broken pieces.
When the idol into which has converted his loved one is dethroned, he generally changes his creed.
A circumpsecting lover is a woman's abhorrence: as a calculating mistress is a man's.
Let a lover but put himself into the hands of his mistress, and he is safe.
Since The man she really loves, a woman will shield through thick and thin, through right and wrong.
For, Concerning a man, the only question a woman asks is, not, "Is he right or wrong?" but, "Is he mine or another's?" We men therefore Leave a woman to get her lover out of a scrape.
It is to be feared that the men and women who love but once and forever are not usually to be found outside of romances.
With women, love is a river, ever flowing, from the brook in girlhood, to the estuary of womanhood.
Like a river, too, Woman's love is fed by all the streams it meets.
On the other hand, With man, love is a geyser.
Standing with reluctant feet Where the brook and river meet.
Longfellow, "Maidenhood" The languishing lover has gone out of date; he has been replaced by the diverting one.
And the change is significant of much: The early nineteenth century maid pretended to ignorance; the early twentieth century maid to omniscience.
The early nineteenth century suitor protested; but The early twentieth century suitor has to contest.
In the one case, The woman tacitly acknowledges an inequality.
In the other case, The man has to openly to recognize his equal.
Nevertheless, The fundamental relationship between the sexes do not materially vary from century to century, much as conventional manners and customs may.
For, after all, Always what a man seeks in a woman is: love.
And In all love there is something perfectly and Paradisiacally pristine.
Would the most emancipated woman have love otherwise? At all events, Perhaps the most womanly position a woman can occupy is: with her head on her lover's heart.
At this the strong minded may scoff.
They may.
The obsession of the male heart by one woman ousts from it all other women.
Thus, The accepted young man regards all women but the one as he would regard fashion plates.
To the young woman men continue to be men.
That is to say, A man dives headlong into love.
A woman paddles into it.
And the woman's hesitation at the brink of the stream exasperates the spluttering man.
In short, A man's heart is captured wholly and at a stroke.
A woman's heart surrenders itself piecemeal.
Whereas, with a man, a trivial passion is usually an affair more of the senses or of the imagination than of the heart; with a woman every passions is an affair of the heart.
A man, when first he is in love, is absorbed in the contemplation of the object of his love.
A woman is similarly situated is capable of making comparisons.
It gives to woman's curiosity a curious pleasure to compare the methods of men's proposals.
In love, a woman is generally cool enough to calculate pros and cons; a man, in similar plight, is incapable of anything but folly.
It is a feminine motto that a woman needs to be taught how to love.
Perhaps she does; but most men will think one private tutor ought to suffice, and that tutor ought to be he.
At all events, The last schoolmaster would be apt to regard with somewhat mixed feelings the tuition of previous crammers.
Why go to the trouble of explaining away a first love, if the second is no whit its inferior? Unless it be to overcome.
What a second love chiefly deplores is: that it was not he (or she) who first taught his (or her) loved one to love.
Is it not true also that It is the first love that amazes, that beautifies, that consecrates? (An illicit love beautifies and consecrates nothing: A Maud leaves the daisies rosy; not so Faustine.) Many a woman has given her heart to one lover and herself to another.
The first is always won; the second is sometimes extorted.
Yet, It is wonderful how a woman will contrive to make all her lovers believe they are winners.
It often gives a lady a pleasure to give her lover a pang.
Not many but have tasted the bitterness of the conflict between the desire of the flesh and the resentment of the spirit.
Explain these terms who may.
To attempt by erring to cure an erring lover, is to administer, not an antidote, but an adjuvant.
It works poison in the blood.
When (and if) in a tortuous love, a man arrives at a 'Don't give a damn' stage, he is not to be classed with the animals known as docile.
And as to a woman.
but polite language has its limits.
Many a man has be exasperated, not only by the audacity of his rival, but by the equanimity with which his lady love views that audacity.
He forgets that, as a rule, Feminine complaisance varies directly as masculine audacity.
And yet, often enough, as a simple matter of fact, 118 Masculine diffidence is vastly more potent than masculine audacity.
And further, Rarely need the complaisance that audacity evokes perturb the diffident man; since Rarely need the complaisance that audacity evokes perturb the diffident man; since The true woman may give her fingertips to the gallant; she gives herself to the worshiper.
The pity o' it is that The worshiper cannot away with the complaisance that permits a woman to give even her finger tips to the gallant.
And Few are the women who have plumbed the silent and sensitive depths of the diffidence of her devotee.
The worst of it is, The devotee essays two things: he would apotheosize the object of his adoration and place her as a constellation among the stars; yet he would have her at the same time terrestrial and tangible.
When the woman shows herself terrestrial and tangible to others than he, the faith of the devotee is shaken.
In fine, Every lover attempts that impossible task: the realization of the heavenly ideal.
Perhaps It is in aphelion that the corona appears most splendid; Were perihelion to result is coalescence, perhaps the photosphere would be proved composed of terrestrial vapors.
And if it did (as no doubt it would), would it be at all bedimmed? For, to the devout astrologer Nothing, nothing will ever destroy beauty and therefore wonder.
So, Bodily beauty, where Love is priestess, is a daedal spur to the loftiest worship.
The lover is ever worshipful.
And Where is worship, nothing can be profane.
So In love there is nor taint nor stain.
Therefore, Make, O youthful lover, the best and most of youth and love: never will either recur.
There are as many ways of making love as there are of making soup.
And probably There are as many kinds of love as there are of flavors.
And Palates both sentimental and physical evidently differ widely.
And yet, If you would know the secret of success with women, it is said in a word: Ardor.
And Would ye, O women, know in a word the secret of success with men? It lies in: Responsiveness.
In matters amatory or rather pre amatory feminine tactics are infallible and consummate: Let no man think to cope with feminine strategy.
A rake has more chance than a ninny.
Which doubtless has been said before.
In love, as in all things, indecision spells ruination.
For There is a curious antagonism between the sexes.
They are in a manner foes, not friends.
The successful wooer is the captor, the raptor; the bride is the capture, the rapture.
And Even she who is minded to be caught will not spare her huntsman the ardor of the chase, and lightly esteems him who imagines she is to be lightly won.
In the chess like game of love making, no woman plays for check mate: the game interests her too much to bring it to a finish.
What pleases her most is stale mate, where, though the King cannot be captured, the captress can maneuver without end.
A man imagines he wins by strenuous assault.
The woman knows the victory was due to surrender.
Etymologically as well as metaphorically and veritably.
Wouldst thou ask ought of a woman? Question her eyes: they are vastly more voluble than her tongue.
Indeed, There is no question too subtle, too delicate, too recondite, or too rash, for human eyes to ask or answer.
And He who has not learned the language of the eyes, has yet to learn the alphabet of love.
Besides, Love speaks two languages: one with the lips; the other with the eyes.
(There is really a third; but this is Pentecostal.) At all events, Lovers always talk in a cryptic tongue.
There is but one universal language: the ocular not Volapuk nor Esperanto is as intelligible or as efficacious as this.
No woman can be coerced into love, though she may be coerced into marriage.
And Man, the clumsy wielder of one blunt weapon, often enough stands agape at his own powerlessness before the invulnerable woman of his desire.
Indeed, The battle between the coquettish maid and determined man is like the battle between the Retiarius and the Mirmillio.
The coquetry ensnares the man as with a net against which his sword is useless.
A woman's emotions are as practical as a man's reason.
A man's emotions are never practical.
This is why, In the emotional matter of love, men and women so often lash.
And perhaps It is a beneficial thing for the race that a woman's emotions are practical.
For If neither the man nor the woman curbed the mettlesome Pegasus "Emotion", methinks the colts and fillies would want for hay and oats.
It is a moot question which is the more fatally fascinating: the uniformed nurse or the weeded widow.
But Who has yet discovered the secret springs of fascination? For example, How is it that certain eyes and lips will enthrall, while others leave us cold and inert? Does the potency lie in the eyes and the lips, or is there some inscrutable and psychic power? At all events, who will explain how it is that A man will sometimes forsake the most beautiful of wives and a woman will forsake the kindest of husbands to follow recklessly one who admits no comparison with the one forsaken? All we can say is that The potency of personality exceeds the potency of beauty.
For, Powerful as is physical charm, it counts not for all in the matter of love.
Yet what it may be that does count, and how and why it does count, no man living shall say.
For Is even love aware of all its seeks? And Is it given to any to grant all that love beseeches? And yet Were all love sought bestowed, what sequel? Perhaps 't were well to leave love but semi satisfied.
At bottom the real question is this: What will win and keep me another heart? But How to win and keep another heart, that is a thing has to be found out for oneself if it be discoverable.
And always by the experimental method.
Since In matters amatory, there is no a priori reasoning possible.
All we know is that There is nothing more potent than passion.
And The chasm, which seems to innocence to yawn between virtue and frailty, is leapt by that Pegasus, Passion, at a bound but he blinds his rider in the feat.
In spite of the poesy of love, deeds are more potent than words; though perhaps it is well to pave the way for the one by the other.
In spite, too of the piety of love, love laughs at promises that is, the promises that affect it.
There is one miracle that women can always perform, and always it astonishes the man; it is this: to change from the recipient into the appellant.
That is to say, When woman, usually regarded as the receiver, becomes the giver, or rather the demander, man's wonderment surpasses words.
And let it be remembered that There is no re crossing this Rubicon.
Mistrust a prolonged and obdurate resistance.
Either you are out classed, or you are out experienced.
And, besides, Surrender after prolonged resistance rarely is brought about by emotion.
A woman never really quite detests daring.
This is why Much is a forgiving a daring man.
So, too, Much is forgiven a pretty woman by the men.
If the beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water, the beginning of love is as when one kindleth a fire.
The eye tells more than the tongue.
And If the eye and the tongue contradict each other, believe the eye.
There is an indifference that attracts, and there is an indifference that repels.
He is a sagacious man, and she is a sagacious woman, who will differentiate them.
The question resolves itself into that which so often puzzles the angler, how much line to let out.
About one thing there need be no hesitation, When your fish is within reach, be quick with the landing net or even with the gaff.
In the matter of wooing, soon enough does the young girl learn to prefer the mature manners of the man of the world to the gaucheries of inexperienced youth.
As to the man! How curious the things that appeal to this lord of creation, Man! a half averted face a laughing gesture a merry eye an all but imperceptible tone of the voice the scarce felt touch of a reluctant hand a semi tender phrase an unexpected glance the momentary pressure of petulant lips a blanched cheek a look prolonged one fractional part of a second beyond its wont an infinitesimal drooping of the eyelid a speaking silence a half caught sigh these will entrap the male brute where green widths that were never dried will not hold him.
But By what men are won, most women seem thoroughly to comprehend.
By what women are won, few men know.
Perhaps No woman knows by what she herself is won.
One thing there is, at all events, to which woman will always succumb: tenderness.
But remember, Dames, that Tenderness is extremely difficult of simulation.
Or rather, Tenderness is so delicate and deep seated a feeling, that few care to attempt its simulation.
A woman who gives herself too freely is apt to regret the giving.
In time, too, she discovers that, as a matter of fact, No woman can give her real self twice: one or other gift will prove to be a loan.
(And It is always and only the first recipient that causes a woman's heart to flutter, and often it flutters long.) 144 A second gift is generally a mortgage if it is not a sale.
A mortgage is difficult to bind.
For There is a statute of limitations in love as there is in law.
Nor is the former to be set aside by bond.
That pair is in a parlous state when either party discovers that the title was not properly searched.
Since Everybody expects a fee simple, though few deserve it, God wot! Perhaps the most durable conquest is the incomplete one.
Which sounds illogical.
But it is well to remember that Repletion seems to cause, in the man, temporary indifference; while Repletion causes, in the woman, enduring content.
And in this we can detect a significant distinction between the sexes: namely the fact that A single goal satisfies most women; No single goal ever yet satisfied the restless spirit of man.
What gives keenest joy is the evocation of latent passion.
For Each takes pleasure in believing that he or she alone can evoke this passion.
Accordingly, The premature confession of passion, and the confession of premature passion, both rankle in the breast and, probably, in the breast of both penitent and confessor.
What intensity of feeling a woman can throw into the enunciation of a Christian name! There is perhaps no better clue to possession that this.
For, probably, Not until a man's Christian mane is ecstatically uttered is a woman wholly his.
Men and women content with the different weapons.
This is why Men are rarely intrepid in the presence of women; but women rarely stand in awe of men.
Nothing differentiates the sexes more than this; but the psychological reason is difficult to discover.
Perhaps, The making of love is a sort of duel, the conditions of which are that the man shall doff all his armor and the woman may don all hers.
Indeed, The battle of love making would be an unequal combat, even were both contestants fully panoplied; for, A woman's derision will pierce any mail.
In fact, No armor is impervious to woman's shafts be they those of laughter or be they those of love.
So The veriest roué' is vulnerable to the veriest maid.
But For each man she meets, a woman carries in her quiver but one shaft.
If that misses its aim, she is powerless: it is like a dart without a thong; when thrown, the man can close.
But Always it devolves upon the man to take the initiative.
But, again, Always the man must pretend that he takes no initiative.
But, again, Always the woman must pretend that she gives no opportunity.
The game of love is not only one of chance but one of skill.
What irks man is that a woman pretends that she must be circumvented by wiles.
But Man was ever a clumsy wooer.
Nevertheless, It is only the man who thinks he is too venturesome.
Since The iciest woman sometimes thaws.
And The austerer a woman, the sweeter her surrender.
And, again, A woman is never sweeter than in surrender.
Accordingly, "De l'audace, et encore de l'audace, et toujours de l'audace" should be the motto of every wooer.
Since Audacity if beloved of women; but it must be an audacity born of Sincerity and educated b y Discretion.
At all events Beware timidity, it is fatal.
Danton With women, nothing is more conquering than conquest; nothing so irresistible as resistance.
On the other hand, Resistance on the part of the woman is an effort put forth for the purpose of defeating its own object.
A man prizes only what he has fought for.
No one knows this better than a woman.
This is why A woman's capitulation she always makes to appear as a capture.
And Where there are no defense works, a woman will erect them.
Foolish that man who does not storm entrenchments.
For Resistance on the part of a woman is a wall which a man is expected to leap.
His agility is the measure of her approbation.
Arouse a woman's interest, and you arouse much.
But Having failed, disappear.
Yet It takes very many futile attempts to make a failure.
At the same time, Importunity is an inferior weapon.
A conditional surrender is no surrender.
But A woman's surrender is in reality a desertion, a going over to the enemy.
Thenceforward she is an ally.
Indeed A woman's capitulation is her conquest.
Let no amount of simulated austerity deter you.
The marble Galatea came to life at the prayer of a man.
The number of modes in which a woman can say 'Yes' has not, up to the present, be accurately enumerated; but perhaps the one most frequently in use is the negative imperative.
And Many are the men who have puzzled long and painfully over the motives of a woman's 'No.' Yet in nine cases out of ten a woman says 'No' merely because she feels herself on the brink of saying 'Yes'.
In other words, It is often mistrust of herself that leads many a woman to refuse it will the lips the consent that is fluttering at her heart.
Perhaps that is why With woman 'Yea' and 'Nay' are meaningless and interchangeable terms.
'Ware a show of excessive feeling.
It is proof, either that it is shallow and evanescent, or that it is put on.
At all events Excessive feeling is rarely taken seriously.
Now Seriousness adds a spice to gallantry.
But, like spice, a little is ample.
Many men think it is the woman who has to be persuaded.
It is not the woman; it is her scruples.
Besides, "Nemo repente turpissimus vel turpissima".
Yet By thirty, scruples are either dormant or dominant.
Both of the callow youth of fifteen and the man of the world of forty five swear by the woman of thirty.
It may seem a paradox, but it is a truism, that, in matters of love, it is the weaker and the defenseless sex that takes the initiative.
In other words, The woman makes the opportunity which the man takes.
And An opportunity missed is an opportunity lost.
And The woman is implacable to the man who sees the opportunity and takes it not.
Since With woman indifference is worse than insult.
Wherefore Never, never disappoint a woman.
Spontaneous admiration is the sincerest flattery.
Those who know this, affect spontaneity.
But it requires much art to conceal this art.
You will oftener err upon the side of ultra delicacy in a compliment that upon the side of bare facedness.
Do not imagine that excessive admiration can give offence.
But remember that The eye can netter express admiration than can the tongue.
The publicity with which a woman will receive admiration from a male admirer 144 often is sufficient to astonish that admirer.
But Often enough it is the admiration, not the admirer, that a woman covets.
Indeed, Many a woman is in love with love , but not her lover.
But this no lover can be got to comprehend.
To flatter by deprecating a rival is a complement of extremely doubtful efficacy.
I seem to remember that somebody before has said something like this before.
A woman does not admire too clement a conqueror.
She admits the right to ovation, and to him who waives it she lightly regards.
Seek no stepping stones unless you mean to cross: He who gathers stepping stones and refrains from crossing is contempted of women.
Indeed, Every advance of which advantage is not taken, is in reality a retreat.
And remember, too, that though Sought interviews are sweet, those unsought are sweeter.
And Probably no son of Adam and for the matter of that, probably no daughter of Eve ever quite looks back with remorse upon a semi innocent escapade.
Yet The man who thinks he can at any time extract himself from any feminine entanglement that he may choose to have raveled, is a simpleton.
The way of man with a maid may have been too wonderful for Agur; now a days the way of a man with a married woman would puzzle a wiser than he.
What is the attitude to be maintained towards the too complaisant spouse of an honorable friend? That is a problem will puzzle weak men without end.
Of that fatal and fateful dilemma when a wife or a husband falls victim to the wiles of another, there are, for the delinquent, two and only two horns (and it is a moot question upon which it is preferable to be impaled): Flight either from the victor or the victrix.
Yet To some it is no anomaly to pray God's blessing upon a liaison.
But these folk are to be pitied; for A clandestine love always works havoc havoc to all three.
Cf.
Platus: "Malus clandestinus est amor; damnum 'st merum." Will men and women never learn what trouble they lay up in store for themselves by breaking their plighted troths? Beauty, they say, is but skin deep.
That is quite deep enough to enslave mankind.
As a matter of fact, it is much deeper: for, to say nothing of health and good spirits, Beneath true beauty lies an admirable or a loveable character.
And yet or, perhaps, and therefore If by some mischance beauty should arouse our resentment, with what different eyes we regard it! The feeling for beauty is probably more highly developed in man than in woman.
(N.
B.
Perhaps this is the source of the beauty of women.) Nevertheless, It is a question that perhaps will never be settled, how much value should be placed upon mere beauty.
For Man soon tires of mere beauty.
In fact, man, the inconstant creature, soon tires of mere anything.
Beauty should never be analyzed.
At sight of graceful neck, who speaks of "musculus sterno cleido mastoideus"; at touch of moist red lips, who thinks upon the corpuscles of Paccini? More women are wooed for their complexions than for their characters.
Could women only know it, nothing can add to their charms: how provokingly delightful is the uniformed demureness of an hospital nurse beside the elaborate bedizenments of a woman of fashion! The most beautiful thing known among men is: a good woman.
And this is not an anomaly.
She who captures a man by a single charm, be it even beauty, holds him by a weak chain.
Think not it was merely beauty that made Helen or Cleopatra historic.
Beauty is much, and grace is much; but there is a charm more subtle and potent than these.
Beauty without modesty is a rose without perfume: the petals may delight, but they lack an ineffable savor.
Like a flower, too, Though the tangible petals are numbered and comptable, the subtle perfume eludes the sense and is inexhaustible.
For Modesty is the exhalation of the soul: at once it enhances, as it refines, the potency of beauty.
Nay more, The sacrosanct aureole of modesty beautifies all it surrounds: though it diviner haze imperfection there is none.
So, Given a redolent balm, and the lowliest herb becomes treasured and precious.
And Each human soul has its own individual essence; What folly were the violet to envy the rose! Since Beauty is much, and grace is much, and mien and demeanor and wit; but a prepotent and psychic essence there is transcending the power of these.
And, As the suave and subtle essence is not distinct from, but springs from, the tangible and numerable petals, so the spirit perceives that its fleshy vesture is not a thing apart, to be donned or doffed at will, to b e contemned or left out of regards, but indeed at integral and inseparable portion of itself; for In the very woof and warp of flesh, sprit is immanent and enmeshed.
Indeed though in a mystic sense Vesture and wearer are mutually one.
And yet Love ever essays the task of seeking out the psychic wearer beneath the corporeal vesture often with plaintive strife.
When seeker and sought make a mutual search the starkest strife is condoned.
But alack! The mystic unity of the human soul is never wholly divulged not even to love not even to love.
A woman really in love and sure of her lover delights in toying with a sort of coquetry of love; as if it pleased her to try to win over again that the winning of which gave so exquisite a pleasure.
And perhaps The coquetry of love is the surest test of an unquestionable love.
For When possession can afford to play at pursuit, this but proves possession complete.
Sometimes An assumed love will resort to the pretty tricks of a real one, in order to assure its object or to re assure itself.
Surrender after a protracted siege has its advantages.
At all events both M and N can look back to more demi semi happy incidents when the courtship has been long.
Happy that couple can laugh over the incidents of courtship afterwards.
'T is a portent of impending ill if they cannot.
Half heartedness in courtship is not only suicidal, it is murderous.
On the other hand, remember that In courtship there are various and varying stages.
But there is always the home gallop.
Remember, too, that What is suitable at one stage of courtship is ruinous at another.
And It is only the old whip who knows when to push the pace: In courtship to force the running is hazardous.
Though we win, the victory loses its sweets.
And In courtship, men too often ride on the snaffle; in matrimony, too often on the curb.
Courtship asks for cash payment.
Matrimony has often to allow unlimited credit.
Insolvency is not unknown.
In courtship, all auxiliaries but the rival.
No one will impede a lover save another lover.
In the presence of a woman, man is by nature a diffident animal.
The women who recognize this are often the most successful.
Indeed, Many are the refined and gentle women who in after life regret that they did not more openly cope with their less delicately minded sisters.
Nevertheless, Nothing is more astonishing than a woman's tact in encouraging a man.
In courtship modulated and musical tones count for much.
Who with harsh speech would assail a lady's ear? No woman thinks she can be wooed too often.
And Few women can forgo an opportunity to fascinate.
In courtship the woman is the whole world to the man; in matrimony the man is the whole world to the woman.
In courtship the slightest suspicion of condescension is fatal.
For True love is a greater leveler than anarchy.
In courtship, the wooer to the wooed is, in Juliet's phrase, the god of her idolatry; in matrimony he is lucky if he is the idol of her deity.
It is a question which is the sweeter: a spontaneous courtship, or one that has sprung from friendship.
In a spontaneous courtship there is all the charm of novelty; In a courtship that has grown out of affection there is all the trustfulness of friendship.
But Friendship and courtship are two totally distinct things: In courtship, men and women meet on the flowery thorny common of love; In friendship, men and women invite each other over to their respective plots.
So, A friend will show a friend all over his domain; A lover can but point out to the lover the flowers (and thorns) which grow in the soil to which they are both strangers.
162 It is an open question whether in matters pre matrimonial, the mode of the French is not preferable to that of the Anglo Saxon; whether, that is, Prudence and prevision are not more certain harbingers of matrimonial happiness of matrimonial happiness than are impulse and passion.
The French couple, when wedded, are virtually strangers; the Anglo Saxon have already together enacted some scenes of the matrimonial drama.
Yet it is an open question also whether A more durable domestic affection is not built up from the pristine foundation of total ignorance than from that of a partial acquaintanceship.
The American Elizabeth Patterson, before she became Madame Jerome Bonaparte, could write, "I love Jerome Bonaparte, and I prefer to be his wife, were it only for a day, to the happiest union." The continentalized Madame Jerome Bonaparte, twenty six years after she had ceased to be Miss Elizabeth Patterson, could write "Do we not know how easily men and women free themselves from the fetters of love, and that only the stupid remain caught in these pretended bonds?" After all, Little do any couple know of each other before marriage.
Besides Does not a delightful romance envelope the nuptials of strangers? At all events, even if precaution is a foe to impulse, few will be found to deny that Strangeness is by no means inimical to passion.
Perhaps, then, Fathers and mothers and uncles and aunts can form a better judgment as to the suitability and adaptability to each other of two young, ardent, and headstrong boys and girls can these themselves; since Fathers and mothers and uncles and aunts know full well that impulse and passion often prove materials too friable for the many storied fabric of marriage.
At all events, The French mode of contracting a marriage precludes the possibility of perilous and precocious affairs of the heart.
Perhaps The mistake that ardent and headstrong boys and girls make is in thinking that impulse and passion are the keys of Paradise.
Their Elders know that impulse and passion are sometimes the keys of Purgatory.
Prudence and prevision are not keys to any supernal (or infernal) existence; they are merely guide books to a terrestrial journey.
At all events, it is significant that (which might be added as a lemma) Widows rarely choose unwisely! Quoted by C.
de Varigny in the "Revue des Deux Mondes" of January the 15th, 1893.
Over that much bethought of, much surmised about thing, a proposal of marriage, every young woman weaves a pre conceived halo of romance, but In nineteen cases out of twenty a proposal is either unexpected or disappointing; that is, Many a girl has almost held her breath with anxiety as she saw the great question coming; then almost cried with vexation at the way it came.
For, often, Either the wrong man proposes or the right man proposes stupidly.
The woman looks for ideal surroundings, a dramatic situation, and impassioned and poetic utterance; usually, The man seizes a commonplace opportunity and stutters.
Probably, The ideal proposal occurs only in novels.
And yet and yet Perhaps after all the real proposal is more complimentary to woman than is the ideal; at least perhaps The aberration and obfuscation of the man is proof once (i) of her potency and (ii) of his sincerity.
Did man keep his head, would woman be quite so sure of his heart? Yet it may be that in these matter woman is liable to err, since Rarely, if ever, does a woman's heart run away with her head.
When it does Ah! the momentary bliss of an unreasoning emotion! Yet Woman does right to keep her head, for Almost every woman's happiness depends upon what she does with her heart unless indeed she elects to go through life homeless, childless, and unenspoused; for Though it is the wife that makes the home, it is the man who must provide for it.
And since Man, by nature, is probably nomadic and polygamic; not his to debate whether to give rein to emotion.
Woman, by nature, is in far different case: For the sake of her child, woman must bind the nomad to herself.
Accordingly, It is woman who is the true agglutinator and civilizer of society.
Therefore, it comes about that To order wisely her emotions is the inherited instinct of woman.
Wherefore, Woman is the conserver of the nation and this in more senses than one.
There are two elements of character which a man should possess, develop, and maintain unstained if he would find favor in feminine eyes: the first is bravery; the second, indomitableness of resolution.
So likewise, There are two elements of character which a woman should possess, develop, and maintain unstained if she would find favor in masculine eyes: the first is sympathy; the second, sweetness of temper.
A curious and latent hostility divides the sexes.
It seems as they could not approach each other without alarums and excursions.
Always the presence of the one rouses anxiety in the breast of the other; they stand to arms; they resort to tactics; they maneuver.
And, Men and women approach each other vizored and in armor.
But it is often only to conceal the craven heart that beats beneath the brazen cuirass.
Men judge of women, not so much by their intrinsic worth, as by the impression women make upon them.
And women know this, since All women are alive to the fact that the impressing of men is the important function of life.
Accordingly, Great stress is, and is naturally, laid by women upon dress and the subtleties of the toilette.
For, In matters of the heart man is led by the heart and not by the head.
And why not? Since It is generally a sweet heart, not a hard head, that a man wants.
In short, Men are oftener vanquished by a look than by logic; by a gracious smile than by good sense; by manner and even by dress than by mental development or depth.
This is to say, A man judges a woman by her appearance; A woman judges a woman by her motives.
(And A woman judges of a woman's motives by what she knows of her own.) So it comes about that, To a man, a woman's heart is something mysterious.
But Women, who know their own hearts, have little difficulty in reading others'.
It is (perhaps) highly unfortunate that to this word is attached a two fold signification.
Though, as Mr.
Grant Allen has endeavored to show, this is a scientific a method as any.
No units of measurement yet devised are adequate for the computation of the power wielded by a beautiful woman.
That is a significant fact, and probably, could we fathom all the profundities and unravel all the entanglements of the relations between the sexes, as deep and as intricate as significant, that no woman thinks a man can pay her a higher compliment than to wish to make her his own.
For though Woman thinks man her ultimate aim and desire, Nature knows that man is but the stepping stone to the child.
In the end woman agrees with Nature.
We may go farther, and say Women are nearer the eternal laws than are men.
Men govern themselves by the laws they themselves make.
Women are lawless.
Laws are for the temporal, the fleeting; for a given individual in a given society; for a particular race in a particular clime.
Such laws are obeyed by women only under compulsion.
They, more far seeing than men, instinctively peer far beyond the ephemeral rules manufactured by men, into the realm of laws eternal and immutable; these she obeys implicitly, unquestioningly much to man's amazement and, it may be, his mortification; for he sees that she is freer than he.
This is why, For the man she truly loves a woman will sacrifice everything everything.
The same generous sentiment cannot by any means be attributed to man.
Both the wise man and the wise woman but here I am reminded of the recipe for hare soup.
Between the sexes there is in reality but one link the link amatory.
And So long as Nature maintains two sexes, so long will men and women hug, yet chafe under, that slender but invisible bond.
Not even Cupid and Psyche avoided a misunderstanding in spite of the devotion of the other.
And, If men and women differ in matters amatory, it is because men and women have trodden different evolutionary paths: The man, given up to the chase (for pelts or pelf) and careful of his status in the tribe, thinks only of himself and the present; The woman, her sole care the nurture of her offspring, thinks only of her progeny, and the future.
But since The family is the unit of the state, therefore The state makes laws, not for love, but for the family.
Happy that family the parents of which are bound by cosmic not by municipal affection.
Nevertheless, Say what one will, Love scoffs at laws; howsoever marriage and divorce may be regulated by parliamentary statute.
Man, as a member of a political community, may make marriage laws to suit that community laws to suit that community laws "de vinculo matrimonii" and laws "de mensa et thoro", decrees "nisi prius" and decrees absolute; but Law can no more bind the affections than it can bind the sweet influences of the Pleiades.
And yet, at bottom, Beneath all municipal and parochial regulations, a great and cosmic law does govern the relations of the sexes; and The lightest whim of the lightest lady has a definite, perhaps a cosmic, fount and origin.
A man can never know too much.
Perhaps a woman can.
And It is a question how far a man admires a woman who knows too much.
For, If there is nothing a man can teach a woman, not even of the ways of love, the man is apt to be chagrined.
Besides, Too much knowledge is inimical to romance.
War is a man's true trade; love, woman's.
There is no stronger argument against the equality of the sexes than a woman's hand.
It was made to toil? No; to place in her lover's.
In truth, Is there anything more fragile in nature than a woman's hand? But put it in her lover's.
and what a force it has! Anomaly of anomalies, with women, fragility, delicacy, dependence, beauty, grace, it is by these weak weapons that she wins.
So, We watch a demure damsel of some sixteen sunny summers much as we watch a delicate dynamo of some thousand kilowatts.
Both seem so calm, so quiescent.
Yet both, we know, can generate such startling energy, can bring about such marvelous results.
Many women forget that things which men have no objection to their female friends doing they often have a very particular objection to their mothers, sisters, and wives doing.
So, too, they often forget that It is not the girl he flatters, compliments, and is conspicuously attentive to, that the man always marries.
Perhaps this goes to show that There is a deeper and more serious current in the flow of male emotions, which, much as light and fitful breezes may stir the surface, is moved only by, and mingles only, with a similar and confluent stream.
For It is not man's highest instincts that are stimulated by the more superficial of feminine blandishments; though, no doubt, many a man there is has been made permanently captive by their lure.
The truth is that Man is a many sided creature: he will reflect many different rays; but it is only under the ray that pierces the surface and irradiates the interior that he truly glows.
Woman does not lean upon man because she is inferior, but rather because she is his supporter; just as The buttress leans upon the building; but the building would fall without the buttress.
That is, Woman's dependence upon man is his chief source of strength.
Those who cannot understand this may be left to their ignorance.
It is not all women who comprehend the exaltation of mind into which some men are thrown by their presence.
Indeed, Men put a higher value upon a woman's complaisance than she does herself.
To a women, feminine concession appear trivial.
Is it any wonder, then, that Woman calls man's jealousy unreasonable? In reality, The affianced man thinks he has gotten him an angel from heaven.
It is not within the bounds of mortal male comprehension that such an angel should sully her wings.
Women know their sex.
Which, if it is a truism, is a truism that men often forget.
And Few things permit a man to see so far into the subtleties and intricacies of feminine hearts as a squabble between two of them over himself.
A man in defeat generally turns to woman.
A woman in defeat is either scornful, silent, or both.
A man, in depression, falls back upon his only weapon: brute force.
A woman, in like circumstances, does the same.
But her weapon is personal charm.
In matters amatory and maternal, a woman will risk more than will a man.
In fact, In matters amatory and maternal, woman is the truly combative animal.
Many are the members of the one sex that are entrapped by the wiles of the other; but it often happens that the entrapper afterwards rues the capture as much as or even more than the entrapped.
So, it often happens that Girls who are deliberately seeking husbands think love may be won by artifice.
Not until well on in years do Women know that, by men, love and artifice are considered mortal foes.
To win him a wife by artifice would be to a man a thing impossible and abhorrent: yet To win her a husband by artifice is to a woman a thing quite natural.
But When (if ever) the man discovers that he was won by artifice, there are apt to be several bad quarters of an hour.
For, when all is said and done, The man, free and easy, thoughtless and untrammeled, knowing he may pick and choose, never chooses till till there comes the woman he thinks he wants.
Then he says point blank he wants her.
Should it ever be revealed to him that his Want was the result of her Artifice, a very different complexion is put upon that Want.
On the other hand, The woman, deprived of the power of choice, trammeled by convention, bound to wait till asked for, quite naturally resorts to artifice.
And yet, curiously enough, and a thing incomprehensible by man, A man whom a woman has won by sheer artifice, she can love to the end of her life.
But, after all, What a refuge, to man, is work or play! Alas! Women has no refuge.
So, Men cannot suffer long; women do.
A man flies to work, or sport, or to the gaming table, or to drink.
A woman .
.
He who can tell what a woman does in the sorrow of the soul, will tell us much.
Some women, in sorrow of soul, eat out their hearts in silence; other women, in sorrow of soul, will tell us much.
Some women, in sorrow of soul, eat out their hearts in silence; other women, in sorrow of soul, eat out the hearts of others, not in silence.
But Take a taciturn woman seriously.
For always A taciturn woman has suffered much: A taciturn woman is a lonely one.
And probably, It is only women who really know loneliness: Give a man a full meal and an outlet for his energy he is fairly contented; for A man always has friends or a club; women rarely have either.
The most superb of physical charms are powerless unless fired by imagination; as the most destructive of explosives is harmless without a cap or a detonator.
But, Given, a detonator, and the coarsest powder can work tremendous havoc.
What, precisely, will bring a particular man to her feet that is, par excellence, the feminine problem: and many and various are the experiments by which she tries to resolve it.
And, Few are the men who learn that were won by experiment.
For, Man succumbs to his emotions.
He cannot comprehend how it is that Into feminine emotion, calculation often enters.
As there are two classes of warriors, so there are two classes of women: There is the warrior who conquers the world from sheer love of conquest an Alexander, a Genghis Khan, an Attila, a Napoleon; and there is the warrior who captures a kingdom for the sake of possession such is your Norman William.
So, there is the woman whom no conquest contents Aholibah, Cleopatra, Mesalina, Faustine; and there is the woman who is happy with a husband and home Deborah, Vlmnia, Calpurnia mother of Gracchi.
One thing, from men, women cannot abide, and this is a hostile and REASONABLE attitude.
And naturally, since It is only man's reason that is hostile to women.
And When a man clothes himself with reason as with a garment, woman slinks away.
And, quite naturally: Reason and emotion are mortal foes; and It is on the field of emotion that the battle of love must be fought.
For, In the battle of love, the woman chooses and entrenches her position; the man has to act on the offensive.
But Only emotion can cope with emotion; reason but beats the air.
Wherefore, A wise man will neither oppose nor appeal to a woman through reason.
Who can penetrate to the motives of a woman's coaxings? Yet Foolish is the man who questions the motives of a woman's coaxings.
Yet Not to be sure of a woman's coaxings not upon this side Phlegethon is there a more poignant position.
In loving one woman a man believes in all women.
And Not till a woman is loved are her finger tips objects of devoutest worship.
On the other hand, It cannot be said that in loving one man a woman believes in all men.
Which little distinction is proof, perhaps, that Love blinds the eyes of men, but opens the eyes of women.
In other words, Passion obfuscates man's prevision; it does not obfuscate a woman's.
Man gives the rein to passion or ere he knows whither it leads; A woman gives the rein to passion only after she has found out whither it leads.
But when the goal is known, perhaps Women are more implacable votaries of the Implacable Goddess than are men.
That is the say, A woman keeps her head till she can give her heart, then she gives it utterly; A man (perhaps because he has no heart) soon enough loses his head.
So, Before the gift, a woman's qualms exasperate the man; After the gift, the man's indifference exasperates the woman; It is folly to think that love and friendship exhaust the varieties of human relationships: The relationships between earthly souls are as complex and multiform as those between heavenly bodies.
In one thing does friendship excel love: it is always reciprocal; one friend presupposes another.
Not so a lover.
Friendship is largely a masculine sentiment; except among schoolgirls.
The friendship that exists between a man and a woman should be called by another name.
It cannot be wholly Platonic ; it need not be wholly Dantesque.
Yet women generally strive to make it the one; and men often try to make it the other.
And yet again, How many women there be, would, if they could, transmute love into friendship! That is to say, Women regard a man's friendship as a delicate flattery to themselves; yet they instinctively know, though they try hard to forget, that a man's friendship for a woman is extremely likely to transcend the bounds of friendship.
If only friendship would keep within bounds! How many women deceive themselves into thinking that were devoutly to be wished! Yet probably, as a matter of fact, The very woman who avers she regrets that your friendship is not mere Platonic, would resent the Platonism did it exist.
Possibly not every woman will understand this.
Assuredly no woman will admit it.
And yet, It is impossible to conjecture in what an exchange of confidences may terminate: it may be a kiss, or it may be a quarrel.
But Confidences are evoked rather by friendship than by love: A woman will tell a man friend what she will not tell a lover.
Few lovers will understand this, fewer still will believe it.
Yet it is true, and the explication of its truth would be long and complex.
This much may be said: Love idealizes; friendship does not.
At the same time, Love probes the innermost recesses of the womanly nature; and, until the woman is wholly won, The woman resents the inspection of love.
She knows that, To stimulate love, the woman must conceal, not reveal; To stimulate love, the woman must conceal, not reveal.
Furthermore, Never was there a man who could be at once friend and lover.
Which is only one more proof that Never will the sexes understand each other.
I use the word in its purely conventional sense.
The male was ever the more susceptible sex.
And for this reason, Next to sympathy, flattery is perhaps woman's most effective weapon.
And No masculine shield there is which woman's flattery will not pierce.
For Man man, alert in the hunt, keen in business, circumspect with his fellows, terrible in war, man is pristine and simple in matters emotional, and an easy prey to emotional wiles.
In the long journey of evolution from Amoeba to Man, The masculine sex has developed muscle and mind; The feminine sex developed and perfected the emotions.
Accordingly, Man's emotions are the primitive weapons of a savage; Woman's emotions are arms of precision.
Yet Sometimes woman deplores the unequal contest perhaps deplores her too easy victory.
Since, In domestic life, the weapons are laid aside, the pair are then presumably unarmed and defenseless.
For, though, A mat has to be won by weapons, Marriage should be a treaty of peace: thenceforth the combatants are allies.
Many a man, when ensnared, has been amazed at the size of the meshes.
Only a woman knows by what open methods floundering men are captured.
He who by reasoning thinks to find out woman, must either be a philosopher or a fool probably both.
Less of a philosopher and more of a fool is he who thinks to extract from woman her reasons for her actions.
The woman who can give reasons for an action is yet to be born.
The reason is plain: Women act upon intuition, not upon reason.
And He who could make a logical sorites out of feminine intuitions could make a philosophical system out of nautical almanacs.
And yet, probably, Could we only determine her orbit, a woman's intuitions are as exact as the paths of the planets.
Unfortunately, Such are the perturbations to which a woman's orbit is exposed that no masculine astronomy can construct its ephemeris.
Alack, How many anxious star gazers are there among men! The orbit of the ordinary male man it is not as difficult for a woman to compute, inasmuch as The ordinary male man revolves unusually about two foci: his Appetites; and his Ambitions.
Which is the major and which the minor .
.
However, You may trust women to know when he is in peri and when in aphelion.
Many a spouse has no difficulty in explaining away to her lord actions about the character of which even his initiate friends have no shadow of doubt.
For A woman's perception is preternatural.
But no; it is natural enough, since From the days of the first woman to the days of the New one, love, its wiles and its whims, has been the serious business of woman.
Women know much better than men that stolen bread is sweetest.
In consequence, Men steal almost everything they get from women.
At least they think they do.
Which is the same thing.
If the sexes were to change places, more marriage licenses would be taken out.
'Frailty,' says man, 'thy name is woman,' and then he takes advantage of it.
At arm's length it is difficult to offer a helping hand.
Yet it is hazardous to reduce that distance.
Neglect is the unpardonable sin in a woman's eyes.
Woe to the man who is guilty of it.
If a woman possessed only a man's tact, what fallings out there would be! Man's summum bonum is to combine a comfortable home with congenial club.
Woman's summum bonum is the almost equally incompatible combination of a well regulated family and the height of fashionable gaiety.
Man's infinum malum is domestic distraction.
Woman's infinum malum is social exile.
Between man and man, to lay another under pecuniary obligation is to jeopardize friendship.
Between man and woman, a like cause brings about an opposite result.
The man with something of the feminine about him often knows better than his more masculine rivals how to work upon feminine susceptibilities.
Most women know how much to leave to a man's imagination.
But then, man has not much imagination.
Besides, Man's imagination is always highly complimentary to woman.
Affinity covereth a multitude of sins.
To attract sometimes requires temporary repulsion.
But Some women miscalculate their satellite's orbit.
With the result that either it rushes on to certain destruction, or it passes beyond the limits of gravitation.
The woman who to one man is no more than the sub stratum of frock and bonnet, is to another man the centre of gravity of the created cosmos.
When she is such centre to more than one man, her horoscope is difficult to cast.
When one heart lays siege to another , both sides throw up entrenchments; and this even when both belligerents are ready to negotiate for surrender.
But, Never, never show that you expect capitulation.
And Flank movements are not to be recommended.
In conversation, the last thing a woman expects from a man is information, unless it be information concerning himself.
In fact, Talk is a mere subterfuge.
It is what is left unsaid that tells.
Nevertheless, When once the troth has been plighted, both M and N try to utter what has been left unsaid.
But always with indifferent success.
Alack and well a day, Can Love ever say what it feels? It is difficult to say to which sex it is a greater compliment that widows always prove such successful fascinators.
Either they still have a penchant for mankind, despite their intimate acquaintance with him in which case the men may congratulate themselves; or else they have so completely found men out that they find no difficulty in entrapping them in which case it is the women's turn to applaud.
When our feelings are unwittingly hurt by a beautiful woman, the pain is largely tempered by a subtle pleasure, which proceeds from a feeling that, inasmuch as we have been undeservedly pained, we merit her sympathy, perhaps even her affection.
Women seek not so much man's esteem, as his admiration.
In fact, Women would rather attract than inspire.
Indeed, (by him who dared) it might be added that Women would rather be kissed than be sonnetted, which is mighty lucky for the majority of men! The most interesting man or woman is well, perhaps the one most interested in us.
The least interesting man or woman is well, perhaps the one most interested in him or her self.
Never fear but that one woman will urge your suit with another (unless, of course, that other is a rival); for Match making is one of the most fascinating of feminine avocations.
When a woman allows it to be understood that she considers herself irresistible to the other sex, she draws upon herself the odium of her own.
By the other sex, however, such a woman is very differently regarded.
Indeed, Men regard the avowed coquette not at all with malice, but with a very opposite feeling, of which perhaps amusement, admiration, and a certain amicable defiance are the chief ingredients.
It is only mountains that are volcanic or are snow capped; the plains know nothing of extremes of frigidity or fire.
To the woman whom he has ceased to love, the man is sometimes unconsciously cruel.
Towards the man whom she has ceased to love, the woman commonly acts a part.
For a woman to humiliate one man in the presence of another is an offence which neither of the men is likely to forget.
Nor will the one man have a less unpleasant recollection of it than the other.
It is curious to listen to the explanations by one woman of the reasons of the attractiveness of another woman.
Very apt is she to say that the other woman is too "free and easy", too liberal of her favors, too expansive of her sympathy, too exhibitive of her charms.
Ahem! Women know women.
And Women know that women know men.
And Women know that men do not know women.
Ahem! Men in this respect are somewhat different: A man usually regards not ungenerously the qualities of his successful rival; a woman never.
The former will candidly admit the possession of a more potent charm; the latter will trace it to the crudest of causes.
In a word, The unsuccessful man blames, not his rival, nor the women he loses, but himself.
The unsuccessful woman blames, never herself, but either the outrageous meretriciousness of her rival, or the blindness of the man she loses.
From which it may once more be deduced that The unsuccessful woman blames, never herself, but either the outrageous meretricousness of her rival, or the blindness of the man she loses.
From which it may once more be deduced that Men are won by more primitive means than are women.
And, alas for men (alas also for many women), The majority of men are so blind, so abominably blind, that they cannot distinguish the women who are really in love with them, from the women who pretend to be in love with them, but are not.
For because, So completely do women know men, that it is easy for any woman to delude any man.
This is one of the reasons why Every woman is the rival of every other woman: This woman will be herself, her own true, simple, and virtuous self; will resort to no subterfuge, adopt no meretricious methods, scorn to rely upon tactics or strategy, be ever reserved, reluctant, shy; yet fail.
This other woman will openly and blatantly, overtly and unconcernedly, assail the masculine heart with word and look and gesture and win.
Ach! the purblindess of the masculine heart! how it exasperates even the woman! That man has sunk low who cannot recognize and respect the remnant of sex even in a degraded woman.
Woman can persuade themselves and men far more easily than can a man, of the propriety of their actions.
Man is powerless before an injured woman.
He has no more dangerous foe than this.
It is the man who seeks excuses.
The woman braves it out.
Coquetry is Love's lady's maid.
She is accessory and ancillary to Love; she bedizens Love, she tricks her out in gay apparel.
When Love's lord and master enters, my lady's maid is dismissed.
(It might be as well sometimes to recall her.) And Nudity ousts coquetry.
Chastity is a word with as many shades of meaning as there are peoples perhaps as there are individuals upon the face of this habitable world.
Women think chastity is a virtue primarily insisted upon and enforced by men.
They mistake.
'T is a virtue primarily insisted upon and enforced by women: For When that divine, unique thing Love comes to a woman, if she be not chaste, it is she who deplores the fact.
The man may easily enough be deceived; her own heart a woman can never deceive.
Besides, With what righteous indignation women themselves visit unchastity! Between the sexes, resentment is the worst of defensive weapons: in the hands of a man it is like a cow hide shield opposed to Mauser bullets; in the hands of a woman, like a parasol on a cloudy day.
Since Woman penetrates resentment by ridicule; man treats it with dull indifference.
And A snub from a woman is never forgotten.
And for two reasons: because (a) The lord of creation hates to be floored by the jiu jitsu of feminine raillery; and because (b) The last thing a man expects from a "ministering angel" is mundane mockery.
Besides, Deliberate derision murders, not only affection, but admiration.
A blush needs no apologies.
(Why? Because Always a blush is spontaneous, uncontrollable; and If there is any one thing a man likes to see, it is a spontaneous, an uncontrollable action in woman.) When the man has declared himself hers and hers alone; has given proof of the truth of such declaration; has bound the woman to himself by terms dictated by herself then, but not till then, the woman acts spontaneously and without control; then she blushes.
But Seek not, impulsive masculine lover, to explore too many of the mysteries of this thy feminine helpmeet.
Perchance she feels herself so much above thee that she blushes to give the herself.
Perchance she regards thee so much a symbol of the god like, that she blushes for because she is not more worthy.
But far more probably she blushes for because she betrays to thee a mortal, a divine and cosmic secret.
For There is a divine and cosmic secret hidden beneath every blush.
Ah! man, man, peccant, impulsive, passionate man, little knowest thou of the divine and cosmic secret that underlies Love.
To thee, O man, it may be, 't is a momentary flash that irradiates the world, and reveals for a moment a sky above that world; To thee, O woman, 't is the reverberating thunder that, echoing, rolls for ever after unceasing in thy ears.
Is this why, Between a man and a woman, a single look will sometimes change the complexion of an intimacy of a life time? And Not until that look comes not until eyes look into eyes with a penetration supernatural is acquaintanceship metamorphosed into love.
It is a favorite fiction amongst women that a rejected suitor either will not marry or marries the first girl he meets.
Because, To marry another woman after having offered inalienable and unalterable fidelity to one, would otherwise be a blow to "amour propere".
And yet, strangely enough, or perhaps not so strangely, This is a fiction but rarely maintained with regard to her own cardiac transportations.
And for this reason: Woman is, and knows herself to be, a multiple personality; Man, a tyro in emotions, is cast in a simpler mould.
So, A woman may donate herself piecemeal, or over and over again, yet deem herself perfectly loyal.
And perhaps naturally and legitimately; for, That man who will comprehend and appreciate all the intricacies of feminine emotion .
but there is no such being existent.
Indeed even Self revelation is a task no daughter of Eve has achieved.
To sum up: between men and women The consummation of love is a bodily oblation, the outcome of spiritual obsession.
Must I explain this? No, I shall not.
Suffice it to say that The Heavenly Aphrodite is true friend to the Earthly.
So Nothing offends love; since love finds in all that savors of the mortal only a symbol and epitome of the supernatural.
And There is in Love a cosmic force and secret incomprehensible, incommunicable by man.
Is not, after all, Love the one supreme and significant fact of the cosmos: indelible, indecipherable: efflorescing in Man; emerging from the material; idealizing the carnal; pointing to an inscrutable, a spiritual goal? Can it be that If we could explain Love, we should explain the cosmos? What if we could explain why it is that no one single isolated portion of the cosmos can live alone and vaunt itself in itself sufficient , but must seek some other single and isolated portion of the cosmos in order that that very cosmos shall continue, shall evolve, shall go towards its goal .
Do we put our finger here upon some curious and recondite cosmic fact utterly transcending our mean comprehension? Cf.

'Ware jealousy as you would 'ware wire: for it no psychiater has yet discovered a balm.
To make an experiment of jealousy is to make a very hazardous experiment indeed.
Jealousy is no proof of love, for Often jealousy is but rancor under a sense of humiliation.
Indeed, Jealousy is a sign of weakness: The lover whose self confidence assures him of his pre eminence fears no rival.
Yet Male self confidence is peculiarly vulnerable where women be concerned, since, As no man knows what it is appeals to a woman, he does not know on what to pride himself: Even an Othello is jealous of even an Iago.
Yet It is only the spectators who see the folly of Othello.
Desdemonas usually are helpless as they are oblivious.
The illicitly favored lover is never jealous of the husband; but of another illicitly favored lover, how jealous he is.
But Jealousy, like modesty, and like virtue, varies with every time and clime: what is customary in Cairo would rouse consternation in Kent, and what goes on in Vienna shocks New England.
So, How the husband favored lover differs also with every time and clime: here he is mulcted in damages, there he is shot down, in a third place he is tolerated.
How the woman thinks her husband should treat the illicitly favored lover that you shall never find out.
The edacity of jealousy is unappeasable: A wronged lover, in his pain, looks for more pain to bear: like a martyr in an ecstasy, he cries out for further tortures.
In love one always sees higher unreachable heights; in jealousy always deeper unreachable depths.
And There is no wound but leaves its cicatrix.
Mistrust an unexpected change of front.
So, Does your erstwhile frowning lady smile? "cherchez l'homme", or la femme.
Since To arouse jealousy in another feminine breast is sometimes the motive of feminine complaisance.
Indeed, Few women can forgo an opportunity of arousing jealousy, whether in a feminine or in a masculine breast.
Bethink thee of this little fact, O man, when next thy lady comports herself thee wards ultra graciously.
To see the girl of thy heart even if so be she not thine, nor not nearly thine comport herself with another as she does with thee ah! that gives a twinge to the masculine heart.
Nay, lesser things than this will perturb this irascible organ: that the other should admire her charms that she should accept such admiration.
..
yet what cares she that these discomfort a man? For A man's discomfiture is naught to a woman.
In sooth, Take a woman to task for her conduct, and with how soft an answer she will turn away your wrath, how deftly make light of your rival's advances! Man, when he has won him a woman, is, in his great greed of possession, infinitely chagrined that he was not master of her past as of her present and future.
This goes by the name of "la jalousie retrospective".
Women never know quite how to regard a man's jealousy.
It flatters her, yet it pains her.
She is the cause of it, yet she would believe it causeless.
She deplores it, yet she would not have it quite away.
It is proof of love, yet it is fatal to love.
How to treat it, puzzles her.
Implicit obedience to the man's wishes lowers her in her own eyes, and, consequently, so she thinks, in his.
Yet so rabid is the emotion, she fears to provoke it too far.
It places her in a quandary.
She never knows what will evoke it; she never knows what course it will run: whether it will cement her lover's affections, or whether it will dissipate them forever.
It is love's most dangerous foe, and it is dangerous because it is insidious.
If there is any one thing that puts a woman's wits to the test, it is a man's jealousy.
The sheerest and most insensate folly a man can commit towards a woman is to let her know that another woman is cognizant of her jealousy of her.
He may give the latter a very keen pleasure; but he gives the former a very keen pang.
For The cause of jealousy a woman may condone; the divulgence of her jealousy she will never forgive.
What irritates a jealous man is the actions that cause his jealousy; What irritates a jealous woman is the person who is the cause of her jealousy.
In other words, A jealous swain upbraids his mistress; A jealous mistress objurgates her rival.
Many are the varieties of kisses; as many, probably, as the varieties of kisses; as many, probably, as the variety of lips and of the owners thereof.
And A kiss may mean so very much or so very little.
Wherefore Look not upon the lips when they are red; for although A kiss is a small thing, so is a spark.
And always, though A smile is an open window, a kiss is an open door.
Strange strange that from the momentary contact of lip with lip, an infinitesimal surface of epithelial tissue, there an be called up from the deeps of the soul emotions strange as deep; emotions vague and thrilling; emotions to the which to give utterance those lips are themselves all powerless.
And When to the conjoined lips there is added the bliss of an up turned eye and embracing arms .
Ah! well a day, There are Edens for us still, if only we will eat not of the forbidden fruit.
The value of a kiss is determined by the personage on whom it is bestowed, not by the from whom it is besought: which, if it needs any explanation, means this, that It is the man who ardently desires the kiss that puts the value upon that kiss, not the woman of whom it is desired.
Yet women know that, As with commodities, so with kissings, the greater the rarity, the greater the vale.
Osculatory transactions there be as lasting in their results as transient in their causes.
A cheek surreptitiously brushed in the dark is preferable to lips premittedly pressed by day.
What an extraordinary multiplicity of maneuvers a man will perform for "Just one kiss!" But With the precise numerical equivalent of the expression "Just one kiss" algebra has not yet been found quite able to grapple.
It is believed, however, to belong to Permutations and Combinations.
There is a very decided, but wholly indefinable, line of demarcation between the kissed and the unkissed woman.
In other words, The "status quo ante exosculationem" can never be re established: hitherto the kisses may have been friends; henceforward they may be.
they may be .
.
But Who shall say to what kissing may lead? Besides, Much more kissing than is supposed goes by purchase than by favor.
All which, probably, will be Greek to the uninitiated.
Nevertheless, and at all times, and in all places, A kiss is like faith: it is "the evidence of things not seen, the substance of things hoped for." How appalling the immensity of the results due to the minutest of causes a burning city from a lighted match; a life long tragedy from a stolen kiss! In truth, Fate is often another name for Folly.
A woman who is afraid of a kiss knows much.
Amongst other things, perhaps, that Kisses, like misfortunes, rarely come singly and bear many things in their train.
Despite the varieties of beards and mustachios, never will you hear from your osculatrix the source of her knowledge of that variety.
If by any chance the divulgence leaks out how the girl beshrews the mischance! For, though the man may hold his peace, she knows that she gives him to think.
It takes two to make a quarrel.
Yes: and it takes two to make the reconciliating kiss.
Perhaps the pleasantest and most satisfactory period in a girl's life is the time of her first youthful engagement: Never is a girl more jubilant, never more buoyant, never so charming, so blithesome, or so debonair, as when she is the gazetted about to be bride of the man of her girlish choice.
For During her engagement, a girl is owned and petted; and Ownership and petting are dear to women whether young or old: Ownership is proof, at all events, that she is of value to the man else the man would not sought to make her his; and Petting is proof that the man properly appreciates the value.
Yet meanwhile, anomalous as it may sound, The engaged girl is still her own property, and is practically free.
Besides, What more delectable to a girl than to have captured and kept a real man? This flatters her, uplifts her, makes of her a woman at once: she holds her head higher she carries herself with an air; she shows off her capture.
Besides, also, The engaged girl is looked up to by her compeers, is congratulated y her elders.
Even if she keeps the engagement secret, these compeers and congratulatresses do not (sometimes, alas! To her detriment).
In addition to all this, What delight so unique as the preparation of the trousseau! 239 Trousseau! 'T is a name of mystical import to man.
A woman's trousseau is symbol of two things and perhaps dimly indicative of a third: (i) it proves what needs no proof that, such is the unselfish nature of Love, never can it give enough, never enhance too much the gifts it gives.
Accordingly the bride goes to the man appareled and bedecked to the best of her ability; (ii) It is a subtle tribute to the sensibility of man, of the man in love, who is stimulated and pleased by dainty, it may be diaphanous, raiment.
Lastly, since even that supernal thing Love is not unconcerned with matters practical, (iii) It bespeaks as prophetic suspicion of the little fact that perhaps it is well to go to her husband's home abundantly provided with dainty raiment, inasmuch as the man not in love is not always so delicately sensible of their need.
A girl's first engagement is peculiarly sweet: long does she remember, long meditatively dwell upon, its pettiest incidents.
For, if any man dared give utterance to so outrageous an assumption, The emoluments of a promise to marry are as sweet to the donatress as undoubtedly they are to the accepter.
And why not, pray? Nevertheless, A certain practical sobriety supervenes upon subsequent affairs of the heart.
For The recurrence of love is apt to spoil its romance.
And yet and yet It is a question which woman after woman has put herself, in vain, whether 't would have been wiser to have accepted and retained the romantic love of unthinking youth, or to have waited for the more sober affection of the years of discretion.
Perhaps a girl hardly knows all that is meant by that thing called "love" or what is entailed upon her by that thing called an "engagement".
She has played with love so much, that when a real and serious love is offered her, she still thinks it the toy that amused her.
But Soon enough does the man, if he is earnest and a man never proposes unless he is in earnest enlighten the girl of his choice: for To a man, love never is a toy though mere lust may be: Men never play with love, as do girls: they play with lust, as they play with bats and balls and fire arms; When men fall in love, they fall in love with a vengeance; and The seriousness with which the man falls in love startles the girl.
The man demands so much; is so exacting' so peremptory; so unyielding; so frightfully selfish; so terribly jealous of the slightest look or smile or gesture bestowed upon any other than he, that the girl .
.
well, the girl probably begins to think, either that the man is an unreasonable brute, or that her girlish notions of love were somewhat astray.
Then one or two things happens: either the man goes off in a huff; or the girl mends her ways.
The recurrence of a love is a great shock to love.
Love thinks itself a think unique, unalterable, supreme; a thing not made out of the flux and change of earthly affairs, but heaven born and descended from the skies; that it should go and come seems to destroy the fundamental conception of love.
The affianced man thinks he has won him the sweetest, the most sacrosanct thing that ever trode God's earth outside of Eden: a bundle of blisses, a compact little mass of exquisite mysteries, whose every tint and curve and motion are to him sources of wonderment and delight; he is at once humbled and exalted; he thanks high Heaven for the gift; for that comport himself worthy of such gift; for that this wondrous and mysterious little thing called "a woman" should of her own accord put herself in his arms, to be by him and by him alone cherished and nurtured till death them do part this indeed gives the mail heart a very sobering, a very ennobling thrill; for beneath the heaving breast he so passionately loves, behind the eyes into the depths of which he so passionately looks, there stirs, he knows, that ineffable, that indefinable thing, a woman's heart; and that TO HIM has been committed the keeping of that heart this rouses in him the manly virtues as no other thing rouses them.
Strong is the man who can live up to these emotions; sage the woman who knows what she has aroused.
The philanderer or the flirt to whom love making and love taking have been a pasttime is appalled at the seriousness of love when real love is offered him or her.
For often enough The philanderer or the flirt thinks compliments and cajolery the food of love: in time they discover that love is a veritable sarcophagus! Many an accepted lover (both masculine and feminine) tries to make up for coldness of passion by warmness of affection: a subterfuge of dubious efficacy.
For though Affection seeks affection, passion is only appeased by passion.
Yet When one loves passionately, and the other languidly accepts, it is well perhaps for that other sometimes to be a little "unfaithful to the truth" and to simulate an unfelt ardor.
But, always this is of questionable value, for Love abhors simulation of anything even of ardor.
Tennyson, "Love and Duty".
If mutual confidence is not established at the moment of betrothal, it will never afterwards be established.
And Woeful will be the plight of those between whom mutual confidence is not then established.
For Mutual confidence is the only atmosphere in which love can breathe.
An engaged man, like a hungry man, is an irascible man.
And How often a fiancée is sore put to it, not only to satisfy him, but to pacify him! A woman will often blandly ask why the two rivals to her hand should not be friends! Yet it is significant of much that she does her utmost to keep them apart! Indeed, In no instance are a woman's tact and finesse so exercised as in playing off one man against another.
And yet usually she delights in the task; for Being made love to is to women what killing whether of men or of animals is to men.
In a word, To be sought after is to woman what war or the chase is to man.
The woman a woman accepts a man, then and there he becomes her lord and master.
And this she unconsciously knows nay, expects.
If the man does not then and there exercise his lordship and show his mastery, he will find it difficult to do it later on.
But of course No woman will ever be got to admit that her newly won man is her master.
Nevertheless it is counsel that every man should lay to heart, for Unless a woman is dominated (N.E.
not dominated over), she tries to get the upper hand.
And Only two instances there are in which the woman should retain the upper hand: when the man is either a philosopher or a fool; When a man is both (and the combination is not uncommon), she would be a fool if she did not retain the upper hand! But Little does a woman esteem him to does not sway nay, who does not sacrifice, it may be: her to his will.
Of that engaged pair who can confidingly speak the one t the other of the dawn of their mutual attraction, little need be feared; if they cannot, very much may be feared.
For Love, without confidence, is as defunct as faith without works.
For If M cannot confide in N, it probably means that K and L have, or that O and P will.
So tremendous are the results of the gift of self that Nature herself seems to have ordained that the feminine sacrifice shall be utter and complete.
For, A man's interests may be many and and behold, a bold girl will appear and carry off the shy man! Perhaps to the life long chagrin and sorrow of all three.
Often, oh! how often, an awkward and sophisticated youth and a prim maid with down cast eyes will sit together, waltz together, and the one never get one inch the nearer to the other, though soul and mind and body crave a closer union.
The youth would give the solid earth nay, the solid earth would be naught to gain him the courage to clasp the maiden to his breast; yet, so intense his awe, he would not strain a spider's web to risk the maid's good will.
The maid who shall say what passes in her mind? That the youth should adventure, she could wish; yet his very hesitancy bespeaks his devotion true.
Were he to fall about her neck, embrace her close, and demand the kiss of love most like she would recoil aghast at first! Yet if he desisted she would also recoil aghast.
What should he do, poor awkward youth? what she? One thing onlookers will do: smile, and simper, and smile again; but in their inmost heart of hearts they will envy that awkward youth, that simple maid.
For because, in this the first symptoms of unsolicited and reciprocal love, they will recognize something of the divine and mystical nature of Love itself, of Love untrammeled by convention or law; of Love itself, in its purity, its intensity, its diffidence, its terrifying yet restraining force.
Ah! Love, not in every conflict art thou victor crowned.
Eros anikate machan.
Sophocles, Antigone, 781 Marriage laws are framed, not for or by the likes and dislikes of men and women, but by the exigencies of social, often of political, economy.
Therefore Men and women's likes and dislikes are obliged to conform to the usages demanded by social and political economy: so In Turkey women accept with a good grace the custom of a plurality of wives; in Tibet men accept with good grace a plurality of husbands.
In the western world ..
Humph! Always will there be everywhere prevalent a latent hostility between the likes and dislikes of men and women on one hand, and the laws enforced by a social and political community on the other.
This is why Always there will be those who will try to "reform" the marriage state: some looking only to the likes and dislikes of men and women, others only to the advantages which shall accrue to the State.
So, Some there will be will always advocate a loosening of the marriage bond, others who will seek to make it indissoluble.
Both should remember that The unit of the State is the family; therefore the State makes laws, not to suit the tastes or convenience of the husband and the wife, but for the good and preservation of the family.
All of which, surely, is right and proper, since It is the business of the State to make laws governing the welfare of the generations to come.
In fine The children they are the pivot about which all matrimonial controversies should turn.
Reformers of marriage laws should seek a preventative, not a cure; since It is doubtful whether the ills of matrimony are really curable, for, generally speaking, Matrimonial incompatibility is a malignant, not a benignant, disease; its prognosis is doubtful; nor does it run a regular course.
Many are the women who, soon after marriage, silently turn over in their minds this little problem: whether it were better to marry the man they loved but who did not love them; or to marry the man who loved them but to whom they were indifferent.
And The man a woman ultimately marries will give her no clue to the solution.
And for the following reasons: (i) He, fond wight, does not know that any such problem is agitating her little brain; and (ii) She, of course, dare not divulge the factors of the problem.
In short, Most marriages are brought about by the following simple, yet fateful, consideration: The man marries the woman he wants; the woman marries the man who wants her.
The two propositions, though apparently identical, often produce results very far from identical.
And yet, Sometimes sometimes that glorious dream comes true, in which a hale and heart whole youth implants the first pure passionate kiss upon the lips of a hale and heart whole girl.
Ah, happy twain! For them the sun shines, the great earth spins, and constellations shed their selectest influence.
'T is a dream that all youth dreams.
'T is a dream makes wakeful life worth living.
Ah! the wild dream of youth! The maenad dream! The spring time dream! Of the maid: the dim, dim dream of stalwart man offering a love supreme without alloy, and taking, forceful, a love as flawless, as supreme; a steady breast on which to lean, strong circling arms, a face set firm against the world, a face that softens only to her up turned eyes that seek the lover who is hers and hers alone; a dream of music, color, and the swaying dance; of rivals splendidly out shone; of home and friends and trappings; of raiment.
Retinue; of ordered bliss; and by and by, in a still dimmer far off time, a time un whispered to herself, of baby fingers, baby lips .
.
Of the youthful man: a vivid dream, involved, unsteady, shifting; a dream of lust and love and smoke, and flame and fame; of cuirass and horse and saber; of blood and battle; of high place; of many dominated by his look and gesture; of mighty man, and orders issued, preemptory, not to be gain said; also of lithe arms, a supple waist, sweetly soft entwining limbs, a gentle girlish woman all his own who never was another's and always will be his; and an heir and household gods.
Ah! the wild dream of youth! Youths, dream ye while ye may! And you, ye aged, I charge ye do not wake them: it is the dream makes wakeful life worth living.
And yet and yet, Sometimes sometimes, alack and fie for shame, things come to such a pass, between husband and wife, that a modus viviendi has to be tacitly agreed upon.
In that case, alas! Too often, between husband and wife, it depends upon who is the better actor and liar to their shame be it said.
But before this happens, much else must have happened.
For, Here and there, ahem! we meet a woman who is like the moon: she circles sedately round, and dutifully faces, the planet to which she is united; but that planet does not know that she is irradiated and warmed by a far distant sun a sun which symbolizes, ahem! Duty, or Necessity, or Affection for her children, or (tell it not in Gath) Affection for another.
And here and there, ahem! we meet a man who, like the sun, shines steadfastly enough upon his own earth, but shines also, all unbeknown to earth, upon other earths and errant comets and small aerolites.
As it is usually physical or sentimental characteristics that bring a man and a woman into the field of mutual attraction, so it is generally physical or sentimental characteristics that drag them apart.
Thus, A clever wife will put up with a stupid husband, and an intellectual man will get on admirably with a dull but domestic woman.
But If either party to the marriage contract disregards or is unable to appease the demands made upon him or her for sympathy or emotion, there is likely to be trouble; for Sentiment, not intellect, is the cementing material in marriage, and If a man and wife cannot effuse a mutual sentiment, gradually they will grow apart.
Indeed, The demands of the emotions are at once more imperious and tyrannical, and more fastidious and critical, than are the demands of the mind.
Of all of which, what is the moral? This: The married pair who would live in amity, not to say in affection, must so live as that each shall persuade the other is the sole personage under the roof of heaven that he or she desires.
Alas! The unwritten motto of many a married couple is: The Heart Knoweth its own Bitterness.
Marriage reveals the moods of a man.
What is an ideal marriage? That perhaps in which the man is to the woman at once friend, husband, and lover.
But some people prefer these functions distinct.
That is a happy marriage in which a woman's husband is also her confidant.
And always, Husband and wife should move like binary stars: revolving about a common centre; mutually attractive; and, unless closely viewed, presenting a single impression.
Matrimony is sometimes a terrible iconoclast.
Whether it throws down the images of false or of true gods, depends on the religion of the worshipper.
It would be difficult, sometimes, to determine whether constancy was an autogenous or enforced virtue.
Never play pranks with your wife, your horse, or your razor.
There is a thing which not gold nor favor nor even love can buy.
Its true name is secret; but it is content to be called Sympathy.
Accordingly, Let no man or woman think when he or she has won wife or husband all has been won that is necessary.
For, If sympathy cannot be gained from one quarter, it will probably be sought in another.
At the moment of the formation of a matrimonial syndicate of two, each member of this as yet unincorporated joint stock company verily believes that each has put into the concern his whole real and personal property.
Yet it is to be feared that, although The woman, possibly, invests her whole capital, the man often, no doubt, unwittingly to himself retains not a few unmatured bonds and debentures.
That is to say, Love, it is to be feared, is often enough a bargain in which the woman comes off second best.
For A woman gives herself; man accepts the gift.
Rarely, if ever, does a man give himself.
He cannot.
His work, his play, his politics, his friends, his club these are matters to him highly important.
To a woman the only highly important things are: her husband and her home.
A woman rules until she tries to rule, which will be an enigma to many.
Out of a wife's obedience will grow her governance; never out of her dominance.
Those who think this sheer nonsense, are welcome to think so.
But it is worth thinking about.
A man ought to rule his wife.
Granted.
But he cannot do this unless he rules himself.
The Colonel of a Regiment cannot command if he himself breaks the King's or the State's Regulations.
And An uncontrolled wife deems her husband indifferent or weak.
The number of husbands who, though they think they rule, yet in reality are ruled, would astonish not their wives, but themselves.
It is customary to call the man the head of the household; yet, between man and wife, it is a question after all whether it is not the stronger will and the cooler judgment that should, and generally does, guide the family, independent of sex or custom.
As in the solar spectrum, so in love: beyond and intermingled with the visible rays of passion are numerous actinic but invisible rays of affection, invisible to careless spectators, but known and felt by the recipients.
These, too, must be introduced if the connubial domicile is to be warmed as well as illuminated.
The marriage tie loosens all other ties.
In fact, Neither men or women are always aware of the absoluteness of the marriage tie: thenceforward the woman belongs not to her own people, hardly to herself.
As to the man, well, Often a wife will actually be jealous of the time and attention her husband spends on things and matters unconnected with her his work his play his politics his friends his club.
Many are there who still believe that the marriage service, like a legal indenture, irrevocably entails the whole estate of a human heart.
In sober truth, There never was a married couple yet who had not to purchase their own happiness.
And The only charms that increase in value as time goes on are the charms of character; beside these, those of person, and even those of mind, are weak.
In short, In marriage, as in every human relationship, it is character that avails and prevails, naught else.
Chemists draw a distinction between a chemical and a mechanical mixture.
Moralists might discover the same in marriage.
To encircle monogamy with an ever increasing halo of romance that is a problem deserving of study.
Monogamy is one of the disharmonies of life; it seems (as I have said) to be the decree of politics rather than of nature.
But surely polygamy or polyandry would be more disharmonious still.
Marriage renders no one immune.
That is to say; Unless husband and wife both avoid infection, both can catch amatory fevers.
The woman who has learned how to minister to a man's creature comforts has learned much.
And It has disconcerted many a young wife to discover how important a part of her education this is! Since It is certainly sometimes hard to reconcile a suitor's poetic protestations with a spouse's prosaic requisitions.
In the game of life a man may venture many stakes; a woman's fate is determined by a single throw of the dice.
Thus, How often it happens that a young and inexperienced maid will look about her, will weigh and consider, will pick and choose, and, when she thinks she has found a man to her purpose, will set her cap at him will attract him, enslave him, bring him to her feet, make him propose, accept him as husband, give him all the sweets of engagement, regard herself and proclaim herself his affianced bride, all with most prudential it may be, most praise worthy motives.
On a sudden, the man discovers that this was no real attachment, but a fictitious, almost an enforced, one; that the methods (so he thinks) were artificial, the results delusive.
What happens? The man withdraws politely gallantly: t'was a mistake; he is sorry; they are unsuited; he did not know his own mind; he is sorry; and so on, and so forth.
They separate.
And, in this concatenation of circumstances, action for breach of promise is out of the question.
Besides, often enough, the girl, through pride or through sheer chagrin at the indifference of the man, pretends acquiescence.
What happens to the man? Nothing.
If his senses were stirred, he himself is heart whole.
He gave nothing; he merely received.
He proposes again to somebody else; is accepted; marries happily; rears a family.
What happens to the girl? Everything.
The man gave her nothing; she gave all her lips, her looks, the recesses of her heart; the premonitions of the gift of her self; for, when she leant on him, looked up to him, clung to him, felt his strong encircling arms, was perturbed by his ardor, she gave that which was not to give again.
Such woman is to be pitied.
For, however much she may strive to make it appear that she gave nothing, that she had all to give again, not even her own soul will bear her witness, and sooner, or later, a subsequent lover (and such girl accepts the first lover that offers) will find a void where he hoped to find an inexhaustible treasure.
For the woman cannot forever keep up a fictitious affection; and languid looks, and eyes that will not brighten, and smiles which are so evidently forced, bespeak her sympathies elsewhere.
But, as Heine said, this is an old story often repeated.
Wherefore Let us pity women! The dice they throw are their hearts and they have only one throw: when they have thrown away their hearts Pity women! Men have so many dice to throw: income, status, title; virility, fortune, fame; good spirits, good connections, good looks; an air, a figure, a soul stirring voice; manners, breeding, force; a good name, a good bank account.
The pity o' it is that The whole marriage question revolves about a single point: The man wants him a woman, a woman who shall be his and only his; The woman wants her a head of a home.
And here again, and once again, we see the difference between the sexes: The one thing that the man wants is: a mate; The one thing that a woman wants is: a head and provider of a household.
The man's thoughts never go beyond the woman; The woman's thoughts always and at once travel far beyond the man to the children, the household, the home.
This is great Nature's inexorable law.
But little knows the woman, and less knows the man, that the nubile girl is merely obeying great Nature's inexorable law.
What price woman pays for her high office! for in this implicit, unquestioning, and unconscious obedience to Nature she performs perhaps her highest function.
On all accounts, therefore, let us Pity women! They obey so faithfully great Nature's law, and Nature so often plays them false so very false, and so very often.
Besides, The woman who gives her hand without her heart finds in time that she has made a sorry bargain a sorrier bargain, perhaps, that the woman who gives her heart with out her hand.
For, Passionately as a man desires a woman, the passionately desired woman will in time discover that, unless she gives her heart with her hand, her gift suffers depreciation.
And Unless a woman gives her heart, how can she give her aid? Surely, Unless a man's armor is buckled on for the strife of life by feminine sympathy, the fight is apt to be a sorry one at best; since A woman's true business is to back her husband: if SHE leaves him in the lurch, there is little hope for him.
For of a truth The strongest man is handicapped in the struggle for existence unless he knows and feels that his wife is at his side not pushing him so much as leaning upon him.
To simulate passion for an hour is possible; to simulate a life long love that is hard.
For Love is a thing unique and unalterable (in spite of its various alloys); clip the coin, and it will not pass current.
For Ideal matrimony is founded on a mono metallic basis: no amount of silver will be accepted for gold.
And yet, How often M loves and N accepts the love! Poor M! Also (in the long run), poor N! That, indeed, is a happy marriage where M gives and wants just what N wants and gives: where M and N just want each other.
For Give and take is the rule of a community of two, as it is of a community of ten thousand; The ideal (and probably impossible) industrial community is that in which demand and supply are in exact equipoise.
The same holds good in matrimony.
In wedlock, a virtuous, has probably less force than a vicious, example.
That is to say, A frivolous spouse is more apt to drag the couple down than is a serious spouse apt to lead the couple up.
And Many a mate there is (both masculine and feminine) feels like a pack mule treading a precipitous pass.
Of every Audrey her Touchstone should be able proudly to say, "A poor.
.
Thing, Sir, but mine own".
In other words, The homely violet deserves as tender cherishing as the rare exotic.
What portion of himself or herself any one complicated physical and psychological human being really and truly 'conveys' to another by means of the simple contract known as the "plighted troth" or that of a larger deed called the called the "solemnization of matrimony", is a riddle difficult of solution; and as to how much one may claim on the strength of one or other of these indentures, that is a more difficult problem still.
In no amatorial contract, probably, is it possible to include or to enumerate all the hereditaments, messuages, or appurtenances, involved.
Certainly How great so ever the community of interest, M and N remain for ever M and N.
Is there not always something in the "eternal feminine" which cannot quite coalesce with the ephemeral masculine? Probably, Trust your wife with your purse, and seven times out of ten it will grow heavy.
Many a woman, by man, is accepted at her face value.
Many a man, by woman, is taken on trust.
It is difficult to tell whether More bad debts are contracted by giving credit than by taking at face value.
For The promissory note of marriage is undated and unendorsed.
But Children act as collateral security.
How often a girl, even an affianced girl, accustomed to a multiplicity of admirers, forgets the man of her ultimate choice she must then and there set above all other claimants! If the man the woman chooses for husband does not stand in her estimation absolutely first and all other claimants nowhere there is bound sooner or later to be trouble.
For No man will play second fiddle to any body or any thing; and The realm amatory is a monarchial, not a republican, one.
In all realms, there must be a ruler, whether elected or hereditary.
Always a divided sway results in schism, whether in the family or in the state.
And although Often enough the wife proves herself the more effective Sovereign, the forms of monarchy must be conceded to the man, even though the executive is left to the woman.
How often the only breast to which one can go on to "rain out the heavy mist of tears" is the one inhibited! Two wills are not so easily blended into one as that the task may be left to Cupid.
Yet, Unless Cupid has a hand in blending two wills, it is bound to be a sorry business at best.
Always and in all wedlock there comes a time when will conflicts with will.
If both wills are inflexible, one must break or both will fly apart.
But Love and tact will relieve many a strain.
Though sometimes one discovers that Human eyes have a certain store of tears.
It is not difficult to weep them all away.
However, In the final rupture between man and wife, it is the children that turn the scales.
But, O ye young husbands and wives, remember that Youth regards the whole world as its friend; age finds itself desolate in the midst of friends.
Wherefore, O youth, cleave unto the wife of thy bosom; since A loving wife is worth a multitude of friends.
Sweet are friends, and fame is sweet; but sweeter far a wifely heart whereon to lay a weary head.
But Each married pair must solve its own difficulties as best it can.
If any advice were worth the offering, it would be this: O ye Husbands, and O ye Wives, if not for your own sakes then for your children's, lead a straight, clean, honorable life; any other sort of life leads to despicability, to dismalness, to disaster.
Which only means, after all, that In the marriage relation, as in every relation the social, the industrial, the commercial, the political it is conduct, it is character, that counts, nothing else; Beauty Wealth Culture Grace Wit Intellect Sprightliness Vivacity Humor these are much but they are simply naught, and less than naught, when just this simple, single, yet insatiable thing called Man wants to live amicably, affectionately, martially, with that simple, single, but incomprehensible thing called Woman.
Character Conduct rule the world, the Matrimonial equally with the Municipal.
"The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked; who can know it?" Holy Writ It does not take much to make two hearts beat faster than one.
The heart can deceive itself when it cannot deceive another.
Which will be cold comfort to some lovers, though it may console others.
To admit a sacred visitant into the inner recesses of the human heart, those recesses must be neat indeed.
Remember, too, that you can Never expect an angel to act as a charwoman; the sweeping must be done by the owner.
Lastly, Unless each heart is permitted access to the other, their union is fictitious, perhaps perilous.
Explain these tropes who can.
No man can tell to whom a woman's heart belongs; not even the man who calls the woman "his".
And Let no man imagine that when he has won him a woman, he has won him a woman's heart.
Since, Sometimes a woman will give her heart to one man and her troth to another.
Besides, Many a heart is hard to read especially if it is a palimpsest.
Indeed, many are illegible to their owners.
Nevertheless, That the woman should not know her own heart (as so often happens) terrifies the woman as much as it exasperates the man.
Yet, That must be a curious love that causes the heart to hesitate.
And yet, Many a man has debated for months whether to propose or not; and sometimes a woman will accept on a Friday the man that she refused point blank of a Tuesday.
But perhaps, Where the heart hesitates, it is not so much a case of love as a case of convenience.
For, An overwhelming love leaves the heart of either doubt or debate.
But alas, The human heart seems to be an anatomical engine of such intricate and delicate mechanism that its workings are uncontrollable even by its owner.
Is a constant heart as hard a thing to manufacture in the world of life as is an immobile thing in the world of matter? And matter, so they say, is immobile only at absolute zero when bereft of even molecular motion: a thing impossible to produce, and which to produce would require incalculable pressure and almost incalculable cold.
(Is there no chemical formula for fixing the impression of the heart?) Who really held Burns his heart in thrall, Nelly Fitzpatrick or Mary Campbell or Ellison Begbie or Margaret Chalmers or Charlotte Hamilton or Jenny Cruikshank or Anne Park or Jean Armour or Mrs.
Whelpdale or Mrs.
Agnes McLehose? and who the heart of Goethe, Gretchen or Kitty Shonkopf or Frederica Brion or Charlotte Buff or Lily Shonemann or the Countess Augusta or Charlotte van Stein or Bettina Brentano or Mariana von Willemer or his wife, Christina Vulpius? However, whether it is a provision of Nature, or whether it is due to the perversity of Man, probably the feminine heart is far more constant than the masculine, and perhaps any one of Goethe's or of Burns his inamoratas would have clung to him had he been faithful to her.
And yet, Would you have had Shelley stick to Harriet Westbrooke? and how shall one interpret his feelings for Amelia Viviani? What would have happened if Keats had lived and married Fanny Brawne she who flirted with somebody else while he was sick and did not even know that he was a poet? Yet she was an inspiration to Keats, as Mary Godwin (and Amelia Viviani) were to Shelley .
Ought Byron to have said 'No' to Claire or Lady Caroline Lamb or the Countess Guiccioli or any one of the many maids and matrons that besieged his heart? Could anything have kept Rosina Wheeler and Bulwer Lytton side by side, Rosina Wheeler to whom, before marriage, Lytton could find write, "Oh, my dear Rose! Where shall I find words to express my love for you?" and to whom, after marriage, he wrote, "Madam, The more I consider your conduct and your letter, the more unwarrantable they appear"? God in heaven! what a pitiful game it all is! And alas! as George Sand says, "All this, you see, is a game that we are playing, but our heart and life are the stakes, and that has an aspect which is not always pleasing." See the Dedication of "The Revolt of Islam" (and see the "Epipsychidion").
Letter to Alfred de Musset.
Many a man's heart has been treated as a football.
Yes; but many a woman's heart has been treated as a shuttlecock.
Human beings there are both men and women out of whom, at a mere touch, virtue seems to go: converse with them is stimulating; contact enthralling.
And yet, Powerful as physical or as mental attraction may be, permanently to retain the attracted object requires a profounder force.
Perhaps, though, Beauty and grace and brilliancy may attract; it is only something far more deep seated that retains.
In other words, Charm of body and mind may appeal to body and mind; only the heart appeals to the heart.
Those who know not this, and they are Many, permit the heart to leak through the senses; with the result that, when demands are made upon the heart, that cistern is found to have run dry.
So, To philanderers and to flirts, when a great and true love comes, they do not comprehend it, and they cannot appreciate it.
Wherefore, Would be lover, keep thy heart intact until it be required of thee.
You need not imagine that, because you have once been permitted to see some way down into a human heart, that you will necessarily ever again be so permitted.
Hard words break no bones.
But they often break hearts.
Drink is too often the refuge of the masculine, and a rich husband the refuge of the feminine, broken heart.
Extreme youth thinks the world is a toyshop where anything may be had for the asking; old age regards it as a museum where nothing may be touched.
No heart, under repeated temperings, can remain forever keen.
And As a little body sometimes has a very big pain; so an aching heart wonders that it can bear so much.
And What takes place in the quiet deeps of a troubled heart, who shall know? The way to the heart is not through the head: Between heart and heart, there are many channels.
But three are in universal use: the eyes, the lips, and the finger tips.
Now the greatest of these is the eyes.
The masculine heart will never wholly understand the feminine, nor the feminine the masculine.
(O the pity o' it!) And yet, after all, The human heart is much more the same, whether it beats under a cuirass or under a corset.
Between the masculine heart and the feminine, perfect frankness is perhaps of questionable import.
But why? It is difficult to say.
Perhaps because The aspirations and desires of the human heart are infinite and unappeasable.
To attempt to formulate them is to frustrate them.
For It is as impossible for any two human hearts, as it is impossible for any two material things, to occupy the same space.
Especially when we remember that Between the masculine heart and the feminine is a great gulf fixed.
Nay, rather From youth to age, each human heart seems unwittingly to build about itself a high and ever higher growing wall, impenetrable, indelapidable, not to be scaled by the look or speech or gesture.
Never can heart coalesce with heart.
And yet The absolute and intimate coalescence of heart with heart is not this, after all, the consummation that every lover seeks? To attempt that consummation by mere speech, it is this that is of questionable import.
Since Between heart and heart, speech is the paltriest of channels.
What a thin yet what an invisible and impenetrable film separates those two worlds: the one, that of the visible, audible, and tangible, the world of chatter and laughter, of convention, often of make believe; and the other, the world of deep and voiceless emotions, of the feelings which know not how to give themselves utterance, of affections which crave so much and are so impotent to say or to seek what they crave! It is like a layer of ice separating the hidden and soundless deeps from the aerial world of noise and motion.
What would not one heart give to break the icy crust and see and know what was really passing in another? And how often we drown if we do break through! The isolation of the individual human heart is complete.
It is the most pathetic past in the universe, and it is that against which the individual human heart rebels most.
There must be some profound and cosmic problem underlying this fact which no philosophy and no religion can solve.
That it is pathetic seems to prove it temporary, earthly, a matter of time and space; but, when will the individual human heart coalesce with the Heart of the Universe which, perhaps, is the goal of all Life? For It may be that these little terrestrial human individuals which we call men and women are after all only tiny and temporary centers of conscious activity in an ocean of infinite consciousness; as atoms are but tiny and temporary centers of energy in an ocean of infinite ether.
Could we see the sum total of Supreme and Infinite Consciousness at a glance, perhaps individual men and women would dissolve into a mighty unity, could see and comprehend the whole of the luminiferous ether.
Well, perhaps Love is the only known means by which the individual heart can make any expansion whatsoever beyond its own bounds.
Yet, alas! Nothing seems to break down the barriers of sense.
The human heart beats its ineffectual wings in vain against the walls of its fleshly tabernacle.
Will nothing unite the Boy and the Girl? Will nothing bring the Man and the Woman really together? Yet the Boy thinks that, were the Girl wholly his, he and she would be happy; and the Man thinks that, were the Woman and he to share every thought and every emotion, he and she would want naught else.
Is the amalgamation impossible? Is the coalescence of thought and feeling outside the bounds of human possibility? What, then, impels mankind to crave it, to attempt it, to sacrifice so much for it? There is a cosmic puzzle here with which nor philosophy nor psychology nor religion has yet attempted to grapple.
After all, pitiful as it may be, lamentable as it may be, it is true, and it must be said, that this human heart of ours goes through life hungry, very hungry and unappeased.
For what it hungers, what it has missed, whereto it looks for sustenance, it itself does not know.
Thus, This feminine heart sighs without ceasing for because that other masculine heart upon which it staked all its all, and an all that meant so much, proved callous and indifferent; That masculine heart ceases not to curse itself for resorting to such hasty and violent methods by which to obtain for itself an ephemeral and passing pleasure; This feminine heart eats out its life with remorse for because it gave itself so unthinkingly when asked; though of a survey it thought that asking was a thing prompted by impulses as noble as they seemed divine; and That masculine heart, when the tidal wave of heated passion has subsided, wonders how it was led captive by lures so deceptive and untried.
M regrets, and regrets in vain, that he did not await a purer and more permanent passion; and N chews for a life time the cud of persistent remorse for an hour's poignant pleasure.
Ach! this human heart knows nothing of itself nor anything of its fellow beating hearts.
If it follows its bent, it is cracked; if it holds itself in leash, it aches.
If it calls reason to aid, its soaring hopes are dashed, its romance spoiled, and it itself reduced to the level of a machine that calculates.
If it acts on impulse and, meeting a heart that beats, so it thinks, in unison, unites itself with it, often enough that other soon palpitates to a different rhythm, or itself cannot keep time, and all things go awry.
Poor aching, beating, human heart! It cannot reason; it cannot count the cost.
To it seems that impulse, divine and mighty impulse, is the sole law of the earth; in time it learns that impulse, the mightiest, the divinest, though it may be law in heaven, is sometimes a veritable nemesis on earth: it gives freely, gladly, without compunction; it finds the gift rewarded by consequences too pitiful for tears.
Alas, this human heart! Can no one advise it Is there no advice will help it? Must it always go wrong, and always suffer? Well, If one loves, one dare not reason; if one reasons, it is difficult to love.
There seems to be something cosmic, something transcending the bounds of the visible and tangible universe, in the desires and cravings of this same human heart; this little human heart beating blindly beneath a waistcoat or a blouse.
Its owner is little bigger than a beetle or an ant, and the habitat of that owner is a speck in space; a pygmy in comparison with Sirius or Arcturus, and invisible from the ultra telescopic confines of vision.
What it makes the desires and cravings of this human heart more important, more importunate, to its owner than the measuring of the vastest space? Why is it that the longings, the hopes, the disappointments, the desperate aspirations, and the passionate loves of little human hearts should cause to their possessors such prepotent commotions, such poignant qualms? Rigel and Betelgeuse and Algol rush through space, and about them probably circle numerous planets inhabited by countless and curious beings, each and all, perhaps, possessing hearts as perturbable as our own.
And yet, if our own little earthly Jack cannot get our own little earthly Jill, what cares Jack what happens to Vega or Capella or to the great nebula in Orion? Jack wants Jill; and that want is to Jack the only thing in the sidereal heavens that matters.
The curious and perhaps semi comical but wholly pathetic thing about the whole matter is this: that though undoubtedly our little planet is part of and has a place in this great sidereal universe, and consequently all our Jacks and Jills are related to all the Jacks and Jills everywhere else, yet each little human heart behaves as it were the only heart in the sum total of created things: if it enjoys, it calls upon all that is, to congratulate it; if it suffers, it cries aloud to high heaven to avenge its wrongs: it comports itself as if it and it alone were the only sensitive things in existence.
That is curious.
That it wrongs may have been wrought by itself; that is fate may have been determined in the reign of Chaos and Old Night, or ere even cosmic nebulae were born, it does not dream: if Jill is indifferent or Jack morose, either is enough to cause Jack or Jill to curse God and die.
Is there some archetypal and arcanal secret in this the extreme, the supernal egoism of the human heart? Of all of which, what is the moral? Humph! Frankly, I do not know what is the moral.
Only this I see: that each little heart creates its own little universe: the bee's, the that of its hive and the fields; man's, that of his earth and the stars.
What may be above or beyond the stars, man no more knows than the bee knows what is beyond the fields.
The heart be it man's or a bee's is the centre of its self made sphere.
Some day, perhaps, man's sphere will extend as far beyond the stars as today it extends beyond the fields.
Then who knows? perhaps unlimited senses and an uncircumcised intellect may find themselves commensurate with this high aspiring heart, and an emancipated and ecstatic Jack unite with a congenial Jill.
That there is a Universe, is apparent; that it is one and complete, we suppose; that there are in it Jacks and Jills, is indubitable; that these Jacks and Jills crave mutual support, sympathy, love, friendship, wifehood, sistership, companionship, brotherhood, is also indubitable.
If therefore the whole scheme of the Universe is not a farce, what does this craving of Love for Lover mean? And yet, It is quite impossible to conceive of a Universe of Love, in which all the claims of Heart and Soul and Senses shall be eternally and infinitely satisfied? Nevertheless, on this little earth, perhaps Ill betides the heart that leans overmuch on another.
For, alas! Not even the entire immolation of one heart for another will satisfy that other.
Indeed, indeed, In this life, would one seek comfort and solace, one must seek it in one's own self, or in one's God.
For Only one of two things can comfort: To put the world under one's feet; or, to keep a God over one's head: only He who is "captain of his soul", or he who commits his soul to God, can rise above fate.
There is a vacuum in every human heart.
And the human heart abhors it as much as nature.
What will fill this cardiac void no mortal to this moment has found out.
Art cries, "Beauty", and tries to depict it; Philosophy cries, "Truth, and strives to define it; Religion cries, "Good", and does its best to embody it; and numberless lesser voices in the wilderness cry, "Power", or "Gold", or "Work", which is a narcotic, or "Excitement", which is an intoxicant; and a many toned changeful siren with sweetly saddening music cries, "Love".
And one pursues a phantom, and another clasps a shadow, and a third cloaks his eyes with a transparent veil, or steeps his senses in floods that will not drown.
No, what the human heart wants it does not know.
And, what is more, Pathetic problem amongst problems pathetic, often it puzzles this human heart to distinguish between the things which it is right and proper to seek wherewith to fill that void, and the things which are wrong and improper.
Furthermore: How apt is the heart to seek in the illegitimate for the satisfaction which the legitimate fails to give! Problems ancient as Eden.
What does it want, this human heart, what does it so earnestly desire, so strenuously seek? All about it and about are beauty, friendship, mirth, and gladness; the sea and the earth and the sky; color and music and song; and to each, if he wills it, wife, or husband, and children and home.
Wanting is what? Ah! One lesson this human heart has to learn, so easy to put into words, so difficult to carry out by deed; is this: To get, the human heart must give.
The heart eats out itself; causes its own emptiness; creates its own void.
The selfish and egoistical life breeds always the vapid and vacuous heart.
Would you appease your own hunger? Feed the hungry hearts around you.
Do you crave fullness of joy? Give joy to the joyless.
Would you fill your own cavity, satisfy your craving, attain your desire, find what you seek? Give give give.
The more the better, for The greater the donation, the greater the repletion.
Nature gives, gives lavishly, wantonly, unquestioningly.
Every atom of soil, every drop of sap, goes to produce flowers and fruit and seed: root and branch and leaf are but carefully constructed means by which to transmute sunshine and soil and flower and fruit and seed.
No tree lives for itself.
Shall, then, this human heart live for itself; gather and store up for its own delectation, for its own good? There is no such thing as one's own good: Goodness is mutual, is communal; is only guided by giving and receiving.
Wherefore O frail, weak, human heart, seek thou out carefully constructed means by which to transmute sunshine and soil and showers into flowers and fruit.
O the splendour of our joy, woven of gold in the silken air! Here is our pleasant house and its airy gables, and the garden and the orchard.
Here is the bench beneath the apple-trees, whence the white spring is shed in slow, caressing petals.
Here flights of luminous wood-pigeons, like harbingers, soar in the clear sky of the countryside.
Here, kisses fallen upon earth from the mouth of the frail azure, are two blue ponds, simple and pure, artlessly bordered with involuntary flowers.
O the splendour of our joy and of ourselves in this garden where we live upon our emblems.
Although we saw this bright garden, wherein we pass silently, flower before our eyes, it is rather in us that grows the pleasantest and fairest garden in the world.
For we live all the flowers, all the plants and all the grasses in our laughter and our tears of pure and calm happiness.
For we live all the transparencies of the blue pond that reflects the rich growths of the golden roses and the great vermilion lilies, sun-lips and mouths.
For we live all joy, thrown out in the cries of festival and spring of our avowals, wherein heartfelt and uplifting words sing side by side.
Oh! is it not indeed in us that grows the pleasantest and the gladdest garden in the world? This barbaric capital, whereon monsters writhe, soldered together by the might of claw and tooth, in a mad whirl of blood, of fiery cries, of wounds, and of jaws that bite and bite again, This was myself before you were mine, you who are new and old, and who, from the depths of your eternity, came to me with passion and kindness in your hands.
I feel the same deep, deep things sleeping in you as in me, and our thirst for remembrance drink up the echo in which our pasts answer each to each.
Our eyes must have wept at the same hours, without our knowing, during childhood, have had the same terrors, the same happinesses, the same flashes of trust; For I am bound to you by the unknown that watched me of old down the avenues through which my adventurous life passed; and, indeed, if I had looked more closely, I might have seen, long ago, within its eyes your own eyes open.
The sky has unfolded into night, and the moon seems to watch over the sleeping silence.
All is so pure and clear; all is so pure and so pale in the air and on the lakes of the friendly countryside, that there is anguish in the fall from a reed of a drop of water, that tinkles and then is silent in the water.
But I have your hands between mine and your steadfast eyes that hold me so gently with their earnestness; and I feel that you are so much at peace with everything that nothing, not even a fleeting suspicion of fear, will overcast, be it but for a moment, the holy trust that sleeps in us as an infant rests.
Each hour I brood upon your goodness, so simple in its depth, I lose myself in prayers to you.
I came so late towards the gentleness of your eyes, and from so far towards your two hands stretched out quietly over the wide spaces.
I had in me so much stubborn rust that gnawed my confidence with its ravenous teeth.
I was so heavy, was so tired, I was so old with misgiving.
I was so heavy, I was so tired of the vain road of all my footsteps.
I deserved so little the wondrous joy of seeing your feet illuminate my path that I am still trembling and almost in tears, and humble, for ever and ever, before my happiness.
Sometimes you wear the kindly grace of the garden in early morning that, quiet and winding, unfolds in the blue distances its pleasant paths, curved like the necks of swans.
And, at other times, you are for me the bright thrill of the swift, exalting wind that passes with its lightning fingers through the watery mane of the white pond.
At the good touch of your two hands, I feel as though leaves were caressing me lightly; and, when midday burns the garden, the shadows at once gather up the dear words with which your being trembled.
Thus, thanks to you, each moment seems to pass in me divinely; so, at the hour of wan night, when you hide within yourself, shutting your eyes, you feel my gentle, devout gaze, humbler and longer than a prayer, thank yours beneath your closed eyelids.
Oh! let the passing hand knock with its futile fingers on the door; our hour is so unique, and the rest--what matters the rest with its futile fingers? Let dismal, tiresome joy keep to the road and pass on with its rattles in its hand.
Let laughter swell and clatter and die away; let the crowd pass with its thousands of voices.
The moment is so lovely with light in the garden about us; the moment is so rare with virgin light in our heart deep down in us.
Everything tells us to expect nothing more from that which comes or passes, with tired songs and weary arms, on the roads, And to remain the meek who bless the day, even when night is before us barricaded with darkness, loving in ourselves above all else the idea that, gently, we conceive of our love.
As in the simple ages, I have given you my heart, like a wide-spreading flower that opens pure and lovely in the dewy hours; within its moist petals my lips have rested.
The flower, I gathered it with fingers of flame; say nothing to it: for all words are perilous; it is through the eyes that soul listens to soul.
The flower that is my heart and my avowal confides in all simplicity to your lips that it is loyal, bright and good, and that we trust in virgin love as a child trusts in God.
Leave wit to flower on the hills in freakish paths of vanity; and let us give a simple welcome to the sincerity that holds our two true hearts within its crystalline hands; Nothing is so lovely as a confession of souls one to the other, in the evening, when the flame of the uncountable diamonds burns like so many silent eyes the silence of the firmaments.
Young and kindly spring who clothes our garden with beauty makes lucid our voices and words, and steeps them in his limpidity.
The breeze and the lips of the leaves babble, and slowly shed in us the syllables of their brightness.
But the best in us turns away and flees material words; a mute and mild and simple rapture, better than all speech, moors our happiness to its true heaven: The rapture of your soul, kneeling in all simplicity before mine, and of my soul, kneeling in gentleness before yours.
Come with slow steps and sit near the gardenbed, whose flowers of tranquil light are shut by evening; let the great night filter through you: we are too happy for our prayer to be disturbed by its sea of dread.
Above, the pure crystal of the stars is lit up; behold the firmament clearer and more translucent than a blue pond or the stained-glass window in an apse; and then behold heaven that gazes through.
The thousand voices of the vast mystery speak around you; the thousand laws of all nature are in movement about you; the silver bows of the invisible take your soul and its fervour for target, But you are not afraid, oh! simple heart, you are not afraid, since your faith is that the whole earth works in harmony with that love that brought forth in you life and its mystery.
Clasp then your hands tranquilly, and adore gently; a great counsel of purity floats like a strange dawn beneath the midnights of the firmament.
How readily delight is aroused in her, with her eyes of fiery ecstasy, she who is gentle and resigned before life in so simple a fashion.
This evening, how a look surprised her fervour and a word transported her to the pure garden of gladness, where she was at once both queen and servant.
Humble of herself, but aglow with our two selves, she vied with me in kneeling to gather the wondrous happiness that overflowed mutually from our hearts.
We listened to the dying down in us of the violence of the exalting love imprisoned in our arms, and to the living silence that said words we did not know.
At the time when I had long suffered and the hours were snares to me, you appeared to me as the welcoming light that shines from the windows on to the snow in the depths of winter evenings.
The brightness of your hospitable soul touched my heart lightly without wounding it, like a hand of tranquil warmth.
Then came a holy trust, and an open heart, and affection, and the union at last of our two loving hands, one evening of clear understanding and of gentle calm.
Since then, although summer has followed frost both in ourselves and beneath the sky whose eternal flames deck with gold all the paths of our thoughts; And although our love has become an immense flower, springing from proud desire, that ever begins anew within our heart, to grow yet better; I still look back on the small light that was sweet to me, the first.
And what matters the wherefores and the reasons, and who we were and who we are; all doubt is dead in this garden of blossoms that opens up in us and about us, so far from men.
I do not argue, and do not desire to know, and nothing will disturb what is but mystery and gentle raptures and involuntary fervour and tranquil soaring towards our heaven of hope.
I feel your brightness before understanding that you are so; and it is my gladness, infinitely, to perceive myself thus gently loving without asking why your voice calls me.
Let us be simple and good--and day be minister of light and affection to us; and let them say that life is not made for a love like ours.
In my dreams, I sometimes pair you with those queens who slowly descend the golden, flowered stairways of legend; I give you names that are married with beauty, splendour and gladness, and that rustle in silken syllables along verses built as a platform for the dance of words and their stately pageantries.
But how quickly I tire of the game, seeing you gentle and wise, and so little like those whose attitudes men embellish.
Your brow, so shining and pure and white with certitude, your gentle, childlike hands peaceful upon your knees, your breasts rising and falling with the rhythm of your pulse that beats like your immense, ingenuous heart, Oh! how everything, except that and your prayer, oh! how everything is poor and empty, except the light that gazes at me and welcomes me in your naked eyes.
I dedicate to your tears, to your smile, my gentlest thoughts, those I tell you, those also that remain undefined and too deep to tell.
I dedicate to your tears, to your smile, to your whole soul, my soul, with its tears and its smiles and its kiss.
See, the dawn whitens the ground that is the colour of lees of wine; shadowy bonds seem to slip and glide away with melancholy; the water of the ponds grows bright and sifts its noise; the grass glitters and the flowers open, and the golden woods free themselves from the night.
Oh! what if we could one day enter thus into the full light; oh, what if we could one day, with conquering cries and lofty prayers, with no more veils upon us and no more remorse in us, oh! what if we could one day enter together into lucid love.
I drown my entire soul in your two eyes, and the mad rapture of that frenzied soul, so that, having been steeped in their gentleness and prayer, it may be returned to me brighter and of truer temper.
O for a union that refines the being, as two golden windows in the same apse cross their differently lucent fires and interpenetrate! I am sometimes so heavy, so weary of being one who cannot be perfect, as he would! My heart struggles with its desires, my heart whose evil weeds, between the rocks of stubbornness, rear slyly their inky or burning flowers; My heart, so false, so true, as the day may be, my contradictory heart, my heart ever exaggerated with immense joy or with criminal fear.
To love with our eyes, let us lave our gaze of the gaze of those whose glances we have crossed, by thousands, in life that is evil and enthralled.
The dawn is of flowers and dew and the mildest sifted light; soft plumes of silver and sun seem through the mists to brush and caress the mosses in the garden.
Our blue and marvellous ponds quiver and come to life with shimmering gold; emerald wings pass under the trees; and the brightness sweeps from the roads, the garths and the hedges the damp ashen fog in which the twilight still lingers.
In the garden of our love, summer still goes on: yonder, a golden peacock crosses an avenue; petals--pearls, emeralds, turquoises --deck the uniform slumber of the green swards.
Our blue ponds shimmer, covered with the white kiss of the snowy water-lilies; in the quincunxes, our currant bushes follow one another in procession; an iridescent insect teases the heart of a flower; the marvellous undergrowths are veined with gleams; and, like light bubbles, a thousand bees quiver along the arbours over the silver grapes.
The air is so lovely that it seems rainbow-hued; beneath the deep and radiant noons, it stirs as if it were roses of light; while, in the distance, the customary roads, like slow movements stretching their vermilion to the pearly horizon, climb towards the sun.
Indeed, the diamonded gown of this fine summer clothes no other garden with so pure a brightness.
And the unique joy sprung up in our two hearts discovers its own life in these clusters of flames.
May your bright eyes, your eyes of summer, be for me here on earth the images of goodness.
Let our enkindled souls clothe with gold each flame of our thoughts.
May my two hands against your heart be for you here on earth the emblems of gentleness.
Let us live like two frenzied prayers straining at all hours one towards the other.
May our kisses on our enraptured mouths be for us here on earth the symbols of our life.
Tell me, my simple and tranquil sweetheart, tell me how much an absence, even of a day, saddens and stirs up love, and reawakens it in all its sleeping scalds? I go to meet those who are returning from the wondrous distances to which at dawn you went; I sit beneath a tree at a bend of the path, and, on the road, watching their coming, I gaze and gaze earnestly at their eyes still bright with having seen you.
And I would kiss their fingers that have touched you, and cry out to them words they would not understand; and I listen a long while to the rhythm of their steps towards the shadow where the old evenings hold night prone.
During those hours wherein we are lost so far from all that is not ourselves, what lustral blood or what baptism bathes our hearts that strain towards all love? Clasping our hands without praying, stretching out our arms without crying aloud, but with earnest and ingenuous mind worshipping something farther off and purer than ourselves, we know not what, how we blend with, how we live our lives in, the unknown.
How overwhelmed we are in the presence of those hours of supreme existence; how the soul desires heavens in which to seek for new gods.
Oh! the torturing and wondrous joy and the daring hope of being one day, across death itself, the prey of these silent terrors.
Oh! this happiness, sometimes so rare and frail that it frightens us! In vain we hush our voices, and make of all your hair a tent to shelter us; often the anguish in our hearts flows over.
But our love, being like a kneeling angel, begs and supplicates that the future give to others than ourselves a like affection and life, so that their fate may not be envious of ours.
And, too, on evil days, when the great evenings extend to heaven the bounds of despair, we ask forgiveness of the night that kindles with the gentleness of our heart.
Let us, in our love and ardour, let us live so boldly our finest thoughts that they interweave in harmony with the supreme ecstasy and perfect fervour.
Because in our kindred souls something more holy than we and purer and greater awakens, let us clasp hands to worship it through ourselves.
It matters not that we have only cries or tears to define it humbly, and that its charm is so rare and powerful that, in the enjoyment of it, our hearts are nigh to failing us.
Even so, let us remain, and for ever, the mad devotees of this almost implacable love, and the kneeling worshippers of the sudden God who reigns in us, so violent and so ardently gentle that he hurts and overwhelms us.
So soon as our lips touch, we feel so much more luminous together that it would seem as though two Gods loved and united in us.
We feel our hearts to be so divinely fresh and so renewed by their virgin light that, in their brightness, the universe is made manifest to us.
In our eyes, joy is the only ferment of the world that ripens and becomes fruitful innumerably on our roads here below; as in clusters spring up among the silken lakes on which sails travel the myriad blossoms of the stars above.
Order dazzles us as fire embers, everything bathes us in its light and appears a torch to us: our simple words have a sense so lovely that we repeat them to hear them without end.
We are the sublime conquerors who vanquish eternity without pride and without a thought of trifling time: and our love seems to us always to have been.
To prevent the escape of any part of us from our embrace that is so intense as to be holy, and to let love shine clear through the body itself, we go down together to the garden of the flesh.
Your breasts are there like offerings and your two hands are stretched out to me; and nothing is of so much worth as the simple provender of words said and heard.
The shadow of the white boughs travels over your neck and face, and your hair unloosens its bloom in garlands on the swards.
The night is all of blue silver; the night is a lovely silent bed--gentle night whose breezes, one by one, will strip the great lilies erect in the moonlight.
Although autumn this evening along the paths and the woods' edges lets the leaves fall slowly like gilded hands; Although autumn this evening with its arms of wind harvests the petals and their pallor of the earnest rose-trees; We shall let nothing of our two souls fall suddenly with these flowers.
But before the flames of the golden hearth of memory, we will both crouch and warm our hands and knees.
To guard against the sorrows hidden in the future, against time that makes an end of all ardour, against our terror and even against ourselves, we will both crouch near the hearth that our memory has lit up in us.
And if autumn involves the woods, the lawns and the ponds in great banks of shadow and soaring storms, at least its pain shall not disturb the inner quiet garden where the equal footsteps of our thoughts walk together in the light.
The gift of the body when the soul is given is but the accomplishment of two affections drawn headlong one towards the other.
You are only happy in your body that is so lovely in its native freshness because in all fervour you may offer it to me wholly as a total alms.
And I give myself to you knowing nothing except that I am greater by knowing you, who are ever better and perhaps purer since your gentle body offered its festival to mine.
Love, oh! let it be for us the sole discernment and the sole reason of our heart, for us whose most frenzied happiness is to be frenzied in our trust.
Was there in us one fondness, one thought, one gladness, one promise that we had not sown before our footsteps? Was there a prayer heard in secret whose hands stretched out gently over our bosom we had not clasped? Was there one appeal, one purpose, one tranquil or violent desire whose pace we had not quickened? And each loving the other thus, our hearts went out as apostles to the gentle, timid and chilled hearts of others; And by the power of thought invited them to feel akin to ours, and, with frank ardours, to proclaim love, as a host of flowers loves the same branch that suspends and bathes it in the sun.
And our soul, as though made greater in this awakening, began to celebrate all that loves, magnifying love for love's sake, and to cherish divinely, with a wild desire, the whole world that is summed up in us.
The lovely garden blossoming with flames that seemed to us the double or the mirror of the bright garden we carried in our hearts is crystallized in frost and gold this evening.
A great white silence has descended and sits yonder on the marble horizons, towards which march the trees in files, with their blue, immense and regular shadow beside them.
No puff of wind, no breath.
Alone, the great veils of cold spread from plain to plain over the silver marshes or crossing roads.
The stars appear to live.
The hoar-frost shines like steel through the translucent, frozen air.
Bright powdered metals seem to snow down, in the infinite distances, from the pallor of a copper moon.
Everything sparkles in the stillness.
And it is the divine hour when the mind is haunted by the thousand glances that are cast upon earth by kind and pure and unchangeable eternity towards the hazards of human wretchedness.
If it should ever happen that, without our knowledge, we became a pain or torment or despair one to the other; If it should come about that weariness or hackneyed pleasure unbent in us the golden bow of lofty desire; If the crystal of pure thought must fall in our hearts and break; If, in spite of all, I should feel myself vanquished because I had not bowed my will sufficiently to the divine immensity of goodness; Then, oh! then let us embrace like two sublime madmen who beneath the broken skies cling to the summits even so--and with one flight and soul ablaze grow greater in death.
Step by step, day by day, age has come and placed his hands upon the bare forehead of our love, and has looked upon it with his dimmer eyes.
And in the fair garden shrivelled by July, the flowers, the groves and the living leaves have let fall something of their fervid strength on to the pale pond and the gentle paths.
Here and there, the sun, harsh and envious, marks a hard shadow around his light.
And yet the hollyhocks still persist in their growth towards their final splendour, and the seasons weigh upon our life in vain; more than ever, all the roots of our two hearts plunge unsatiated into happiness, and clutch, and sink deeper.
Oh! these hours of afternoon girt with roses that twine around time, and rest against his benumbed flanks with cheeks aflower and aflame! And nothing, nothing is better than to feel thus, still happy and serene, after how many years? But if our destiny had been quite different, and we had both been called upon to suffer--even then!--oh! I should have been happy to live and die, without complaining, in my stubborn love.
Roses of June, you the fairest with your hearts transfixed by the sun; violent and tranquil roses, like a delicate flock of birds settled on the branches; Roses of June and July, upright and new, mouths and kisses that suddenly move or grow still with the coming and going of the wind, caress of shadow and gold on the restless garden; Roses of mute ardour and gentle will, roses of voluptuousness in your mossy sheaths, you who spend the days of high summer loving each other in the brightness; Fresh, glowing, magnificent roses, all our roses, oh! that, like you, our manifold desires, in our dear weariness or trembling pleasure, might love and exalt each other and rest! If other flowers adorn the house and the splendour of the countryside, the pure ponds shine still in the grass with the great eyes of water of their mobile face.
Who can say from what far-off and unknown distances so many new birds have come with sun on their wings? In the garden, April has given way to July, and the blue tints to the great carnation tints; space is warm and the wind frail; a thousand insects glisten joyously in the air; and summer passes in her robe of diamonds and sparks.
The darkness is lustral and the dawn iridescent.
From the lofty branch whence a bird flies, the dew-drops fall.
A lucid and frail purity adorns a morning so bright that prisms seem to gleam in the air.
A spring babbles; a noise of wings is heard.
Oh! how beautiful are your eyes at that first hour when our silver ponds shimmer in the light and reflect the day that is rising.
Your forehead is radiant and your blood beats.
Intense and wholesome life in all its divine strength enters your bosom so completely, like a driving happiness, that to contain its anguish and its fury, your hands suddenly take mine, and press them almost fearfully against your heart.
I bring you this evening, as an offering, my joy at having plunged my body into the silk and gold of the frank and joyous wind and the gorgeous sun; my feet are bright with having walked among the grasses; my hands sweet with having touched the heart of flowers; my eyes shining at having felt the tears suddenly well up and spring into them before the earth in festival and its eternal strength.
Space has carried me away drunken and fervent and sobbing in its arms of moving brightness; and I have passed I know not where, far away in the distance, with pent-up cries set free by my footsteps.
I bring you life and the beauty of the plains breathe them on me in a good, frank breath; the marjoram has caressed my fingers, and the air and its light and its perfumes are in my flesh.
Let us both sit down on the old worm-eaten bench near the path; and let my hand remain a long while within your two steadfast hands.
With my hand that remains a long while given up to the sweet consciousness of being on your knees, my heart also, my earnest, gentle heart, seems to rest between your two kind hands.
And we share an intense joy and a deep love to feel that we are so happy together, without one over-strong word to come trembling to our lips, or one kiss even to go burning towards your brow.
And we would prolong the ardour of this silence and the stillness of our mute desires, were it not that suddenly, feeling them quiver, I clasp tightly, without willing it, your thinking hands; Your hands in which my whole happiness is hidden, and which would never, for anything in the world, deal violently with those deep things we live by, although in duty we do not speak of them.
Gently, more gently still, cradle my head in your arms, my fevered brow and my weary eyes; Gently, more gently still, kiss my lips, and say to me those words that are sweeter at each dawn when your voice repeats them, and you have surrendered, and I love you still.
The day rises sullen and heavy; the night was crossed by monstrous dreams; the rain and its long hair whip our casement, and the horizon is black with clouds of grief.
Gently, more gently still, cradle my head in your arms, my fevered brow and my weary eyes; you are my hopeful dawn, with its caress in your hands and its light in your sweet words; See, I am re-born, without pain or shock, to the daily labour that traces its mark on my road, and instils into my life the will to be a weapon of strength and beauty in the golden grasp of an honoured life.
In the house chosen by our love as its birth-place, with its cherished furniture peopling the shadows and the nooks, where we live together, having as sole witnesses the roses that watch us through the windows, Certain days stand out of so great a consolation, certain hours of summer so lovely in their silence, that sometimes I stop time that swings with its golden disc in the oaken clock.
Then the hour, the day, the night is so much ours that the happiness that hovers lightly over us hears nothing but the throbbing of your heart and mine that are brought close together by a sudden embrace.
The pleasant task with the window open and the shadow of the green leaves and the passage of the sun on the ruddy paper, maintains the gentle violence of its silence in our good and pensive house.
And the flowers bend nimbly and the large fruits shine from branch to branch, and the blackbirds, the bullfinches and the chaffinches sing and sing, so that my verses may burst forth clear and fresh, pure and true, like their songs, their golden flesh and their scarlet petals.
And I see you pass in the garden, sometimes mingled with the sun and shadow; but your head does not turn, so that the hour in which I work jealousy at these frank and gentle poems may not be disturbed.
In the depth of our love dwells all faith; we bind up a glowing thought together with the least things: the awakening of a bud, the decline of a rose, the flight of a frail and beautiful bird that, by turns, appears or disappears in the shadow or the light.
A nest falling to pieces on the mossy edge of a roof and ravaged by the wind fills the mind with dread.
An insect eating the heart of the hollyhocks terrifies: all is fear, all is hope.
Though reason with its sharp and soothing snow may suddenly cool these charming pangs, what matters! Let us accept them without inquiring overmuch into the false, the true, the evil or the good they portend; Let us be happy that we can be as children, believing in their fatal or triumphant power, and let us guard with closed shutters against too sensible people.
Dawn, darkness, evening, space and the stars; that which the night conceals or shows between its veils is mingled with the fervour of our exalted being.
Those who live with love live with eternity.
It matters not that their reason approve or scoff, and, upright on its high walls, hold out to them, along the quays and harbours, its bright torches; they are the travellers from beyond the sea.
Far off, farther than the ocean and its black floods, they watch the day break from shore to shore; fixed certainty and trembling hope present the same front to their ardent gaze.
Happy and serene, they believe eagerly; their soul is the deep and sudden brightness with which they burn the summit of the loftiest problems; and to know the world, they but scrutinize themselves.
They follow distant roads chosen by themselves, living with the truths enclosed within their simple, naked eyes, that are deep and gentle as the dawn; and for them alone there is still song in paradise.
This is the holy hour when the lamp is lit: everything is calm and comforting this evening; and the silence is such that you could hear the falling of feathers.
This is the holy hour when gently the beloved comes, like the breeze or smoke, most gently, most slowly.
At first, she says nothing--and I listen; and I catch a glimpse of her soul, that I hear wholly, shining and bursting forth; and I kiss her on the eyes.
This is the holy hour when the lamp is lit, when the acknowledgment of mutual love the whole day long is brought forth from the depths of our deep but transparent heart.
And we each tell the other of the simplest things: the fruit gathered in the garden, the flower that has opened between the green mosses; and the thought that has sprung from some sudden emotion at the memory of a faded word of affection found at the bottom of an old drawer on a letter of yesteryear.
The dead kisses of departed years have put their seal on your face, and, beneath the melancholy and furrowing wind of age, many of the roses in your features have faded.
I see your mouth and your great eyes glow no more like a morning of festival, nor your head slowly recline in the black and massive garden of your hair.
Your dear hands, that remain so gentle, approach no more as in former years with light at their finger-tips to caress my forehead, as dawn the mosses.
Your young and lovely body that I adorned with my thoughts has no longer the pure freshness of dew, and your arms are no longer like the bright branches.
Alas! everything falls and fades ceaselessly; everything has changed, even your voice; your body has collapsed like a pavise, and let fall the victories of youth.
But nevertheless my steadfast and earnest heart says to you: what are to me the years made heavier day by day, since I know that nothing in the world will disturb our exalted life, and that our soul is too profound for love still to depend on beauty? For fifteen years our thoughts have run together, and our fine and serene ardour has vanquished habit, the dull-voiced shrew whose slow, rough hands wear out the most stubborn and the strongest love.
I look at you and I discover you each day, so intimate is your gentleness or your pride: time indeed obscures the eyes of your beauty, but it exalts your heart, whose golden depths peep open.
Artlessly, you allow yourself to be probed and known, and your soul always appears fresh and new; with gleaming masts, like an eager caravel, our happiness covers the seas of our desires.
It is in us alone that we anchor our faith, to naked sincerity and simple goodness; we move and live in the brightness of a joyous and translucent trust.
Your strength is to be infinitely pure and frail; to cross with burning heart all dark roads, and to have preserved, in spite of mist or darkness, all the rays of the dawn in your childlike soul.
I thought our joy benumbed for ever, like a sun faded before it was night, on the day that illness with its leaden arms dragged me heavily towards its chair of weariness.
The flowers and the garden were fear or deception to me; my eyes suffered to see the white noons flaming, and my two hands, my hands, seemed, before their time, too tired to hold captive our trembling happiness.
My desires had become no more than evil weeds; they bit at each other like thistles in the wind; I felt my heart to be at once ice and burning coal and of a sudden dried up and stubborn in forgiveness.
But you said the word that gently comforts, seeking it nowhere else than in your immense love; and I lived with the fire of your word, and at night warmed myself at it until the dawn of day.
The diminished man I felt myself to be, both to myself and all others, did not exist for you; you gathered flowers for me from the window-sill, and, with your faith, I believed in health.
And you brought to me, in the folds of your gown, the keen air, the wind of the fields and forests, and the perfumes of evening or the scents of dawn, and, in your fresh and deep-felt kisses, the sun.
Everything that lives about us in the fragile and gentle light, frail grasses, tender branches, hollyhocks, and the shadow that brushes them lightly by, and the wind that knots them, and the singing and hopping birds that swarm riotously in the sun like clusters of jewels,-- everything that lives in the fine ruddy garden loves us artlessly, and we--we love everything.
We worship the lilies we see growing; and the tall sunflowers, brighter than the Nadir-- circles surrounded by petals of flames--burn our souls through their glow.
The simplest flowers, the phlox and the lilac, grow along the walls among the feverfew, to be nearer to our footsteps; and the involuntary weeds in the turf over which we have passed open their eyes wet with dew.
And we live thus with the flowers and the grass, simple and pure, glowing and exalted, lost in our love, like the sheaves in the gold of the corn, and proudly allowing the imperious summer to pierce our bodies, our hearts and our two wills with its full brightness.
Because you came one day so simply along the paths of devotion and took my life into your beneficent hands, I love and praise and thank you with my senses, with my heart and brain, with my whole being stretched like a torch towards your unquenchable goodness and charity.
Since that day, I know what love, pure and bright as the dew, falls from you on to my calmed soul.
I feel myself yours by all the burning ties that attach flames to their fire; all my body, all my soul mounts towards you with tireless ardour; I never cease to brood on your deep earnestness and your charm, so much so that suddenly I feel my eyes fill deliciously with unforgettable tears.
And I make towards you, happy and calm, with the proud desire to be for ever the most steadfast of joys to you.
All our affection flames about us; every echo of my being responds to your call; the hour is unique and sanctified with ecstasy, and my fingers are tremulous at the mere touching of your forehead, as though they brushed the wing of your thoughts.
On days of fresh and tranquil health, when life is as fine as a conquest, the pleasant task sits down by my side like an honoured friend.
He comes from gentle, radiant countries, with words brighter than the dews, in which to set, illuminating them, our feelings and our thoughts.
He seizes our being in a mad whirlwind; he lifts up the mind on giant pilasters; he pours into it the fire that makes the stars live; he brings the gift of being God suddenly.
And fevered transports and deep terrors-- all serves his tragic will to make young again the blood of beauty in the veins of the world.
I am at his mercy like a glowing prey.
Therefore, when I return, though wearied and heavy, to the repose of your love, with the fires of my vast and supreme idea, it seems to me--oh! but for a moment--that I am bringing to you in my panting heart the heart-beat of the universe itself.
Out of the groves of sleep I came, somewhat morose because I had left you beneath their branches and their braided shadows, far from the glad morning sun.
Already the phlox and the hollyhocks glisten, and I wander in the garden dreaming of verses clear as crystal and silver that would ring in the light.
Then abruptly I return to you with so great a fervour and emotion that it seems to me as though my thought suddenly has already crossed from afar the leafy and heavy darkness of sleep to call forth your joy and your awakening.
And when I join you once more in our warm house that is still possessed by darkness and silence, my clear, frank kisses ring like a dawn-song in the valleys of your flesh.
Alas! when the lead of illness flowed in my benumbed veins with my heavy, sluggish blood, with my blood day by day heavier and more sluggish; When my eyes, my poor eyes, followed peevishly on my long, pale hands the fatal marks of insidious malady; When my skin dried up like bark, and I had no longer even strength enough to press my fiery lips against your heart, and there kiss our happiness; When sad and identical days morosely gnawed my life, I might never have found the will and the strength to hold out stoically, Had you not, each hour of the so long weeks, poured into my daily body with your patient, gentle, placid hands the secret heroism that flowed in yours.
Our bright garden is health itself.
It is squandered in its brightness from the thousand hands of the branches and leaves as they wave to and fro.
And the pleasant shade that welcomes our feet after the long roads pours into our tired limbs a quickening strength, gentle as the garden's mosses.
When the pond plays with the wind and the sun, a ruddy heart seems to dwell in the depths of the water, and to beat, ardent and young, with the ripples; and the tall, straight gladioli and the glowing roses that move in their splendour hold out their golden goblets of red blood at the end of their living stalks.
Our bright garden is health itself.
It was June in the garden, our hour and our day, and our eyes looked upon all things with so great a love that the roses seemed to us to open gently, and to see and love us.
The sky was purer than it had ever been: the insects and birds floated in the gold and gladness of an air as frail as silk, and our kisses were so exquisite that they gave an added beauty to the sunshine and the birds.
It was as though our happiness had suddenly become azure, and required the whole sky wherein to shine; through gentle openings, all life entered our being, to expand it.
And we were nothing but invocatory cries, and wild raptures, and vows and entreaties, and the need, suddenly, to recreate the gods, in order to believe.
The gift of yourself no longer satisfies you; you are prodigal of yourself: the rapture that bears you on to ever greater love springs up in you ceaselessly and untiringly, and carries you ever higher towards the wide heaven of perfect love.
A clasp of the hands, a gentle look impassions you; and your heart appears to me so suddenly lovely that I am afraid sometimes of your eyes and your lips, and that I am unworthy and that you love me too much.
Ah! these bright ardours of an affection too lofty for a poor human being who has only a poor heart, all moist with regrets, all thorny with faults, to feel their passing and dissolve in tears.
Oh! the calm summer garden where nothing moves! Unless it be, near the middle of the bright and radiant pond, the goldfish like tongues of fire.
They are our memories playing in our thoughts that are calm and stilled and limpid, like the trustful and restful water.
And the water brightens and the fishes leap at the abrupt and marvellous sun, not far from the green irises and the white shells and stones, motionless about the ruddy edges.
And it is sweet to watch them thus come and go in the freshness and splendour that touches them lightly, careless and without fear that they will bring from the depths to the surface other regrets than fleeting.
As with others, an hour has its ill-humour: the peevish hour or a malevolent humour has sometimes stamped our hearts with its black seals; and yet, in spite of all, even at the close of the darkest days, never have our hearts said the irrevocable words.
A radiant and glowing sincerity was our joy and counsel, and our passionate soul found therein ever new strength, as in a ruddy flood.
And we recounted each to the other our wretchedest woes, telling them like some harsh rosary, as we stood facing one another, with our love rising in sobs; and our two mouths, at each avowal, gently and in turn kissed our faults on the lips that uttered them aloud.
Thus, very simply, without baseness or bitter words, we escaped from the world and from ourselves, sparing ourselves all grief and gnawing cares, and watching the rebirth of our soul, as the purity of glass and gold of a window-pane is reborn after the rain, when the sun warms it and gently dries it.
The golden barks of lovely summer that set out, riotous for space, are returning sad and weary from the blood-stained horizons.
With monotonous strokes of the oars, they advance upon the waters; they are as cradles in which sleep autumn flowers.
Stalks of lilies with golden brows, you all lie overthrown; alone, the roses struggle to live beyond death.
What matters to their full beauty that October shine or April: their simple and puerile desire drinks all light until the blood comes.
Even on the blackest days, when the sky dies, they strive towards Christmas, beneath a harsh and haggard cloud, the moment the first ray darts through.
You, our souls, do as they; they have not the pride of the lilies; but within their folds they guard a holy and immortal ardour.
Ardour of senses, ardour of hearts, ardour of souls, vain words created by those who diminish love; sun, you do not distinguish among your flames those of evening, of dawn, or of noon! You walk blinded by your own light in the torrid azure under the great arched skies, knowing nothing, unless it be that your strength is all-powerful and that your fire labours at the divine mysteries.
For love is an act of ceaseless exaltation.
O you whose gentleness bathes my proud heart, what need to weigh the pure gold of our dream? I love you altogether, with my whole being.
The still beauty of summer evenings on the greenswards where they lie outspread holds out to us, without empty gesture or words, a symbol of rest in gladness.
Young morning and its tricks has gone away with the breezes; noon itself and the velvet skirts of its warm winds, of its heavy winds, no longer sweeps the torrid plain; and this is the hour when, without a branch's moving or a pond's ruffling its waters, the evening slowly comes from the tops of the mountains and takes its seat in the garden.
O the infinite golden flatness of the waters, and the trees and their shadows on the reeds, and the calm and sumptuous silence in whose still presence we so greatly delight that we desire to live with it always or to die of it and revive by it, like two imperishable hearts tirelessly drunken with brightness.
You said to me, one evening, words so beautiful that doubtless the flowers that leaned towards us suddenly loved us, and one among them, in order to touch us both, fell upon our knees.
You spoke to me of a time nigh at hand when our years like over-ripe fruit would be ready for the gathering, how the knell of destiny would ring out, and how we should love each other, feeling ourselves growing old.
Your voice enfolded me like a dear embrace, and your heart burned so quietly beautiful, that at that moment I could have seen without fear the beginning of the tortuous roads that lead to the tomb.
"Hours of bright morning," "Hours of afternoon," hours that stand out superbly and gently, whose dance lengthens along our warm garden-paths, saluted at passing by our golden rose-trees; summer is dying and autumn coming in.
Hours girt with blossom, will you ever return? Yet, if destiny, that wields the stars, spares us its pains, its blows and its disasters, perhaps one day you will return, and, before my eyes, interweave in measure your radiant steps; And I will mingle with your glowing, gentle dance, winding in shade and sun over the lawns --like a last, immense and supreme hope--the steps and farewells of my "hours of evening." Dainty flowers, like a froth of foam, grew along the borders of our paths; the wind fell and the air seemed to brush your hands and hair with plumes.
The shade was kindly to us as we walked in step beneath the leafage; a child's song reached us from a village, and filled all the infinite.
Our ponds were outspread in their autumn splendour under the guard of the long reeds, and the lofty, swaying crown on the woods' fine brow was mirrored in the waters.
And both knowing that our hearts were brooding together on the same thought, we reflected that it was our calmed life that was revealed to us in this lovely evening.
For one supreme moment, you saw the festival sky deck itself out and say farewell to us; and for a long, long while you gave it your eyes filled to the brim with mute caresses.
If it were true that a garden flower or a meadow tree could keep some memory of lovers of other times who admired them in their bloom or their vigour, our love in this hour of long regret would come and entrust to the rose or erect in the oak, before the approach of death, its sweetness or its strength.
Thus it would survive, victor over funereal care, in the tranquil godship conferred on it by simple things; it would still enjoy the pure brightness cast on life by a summer dawn and the soft rain hanging to the leaves.
And if on a fine evening, out of the depths of the plain, a couple came along, holding hands, the oak would stretch out its broad and powerful shade like a wing over their path, and the rose would waft them its frail perfume.
The wistaria is faded and the hawthorn dead; but this is the season of the heather in flower, and on this calm and gentle evening the caressing wind brings you the perfumes of poor Campine.
Love them and breathe them in while brooding over its fate; its soil is bare and harsh and the wind wars on it; pools make their holes in it; the sand preys on it, and the little left to it, it yet gives.
Once in autumn, we lived with it, with its plain and its woods, with its rain and its sky, even to December when the Christmas angels crossed its legend with mighty strokes of their wings.
Your heart became more steadfast there, simpler and more human; we loved the people of its old villages, and the women who spoke to us of their great age and of spinning-wheels fallen from use, worn out by their hands.
Our calm house on the misty heath was bright to look upon and ready in its welcome; and dear to us were its roof and its door and its threshold and its hearth blackened by the smoky peat.
When night spread out its total splendour over the vast and pale and innumerable somnolence, the silence taught us lessons, the glow of which our soul has never forgotten.
Because we felt more lonely in the vast plain, the dawns and the evenings sank more deeply into us; our eyes were franker, our hearts were gentler and filled to the brim with the fervour of the world.
We found happiness by not asking for it; even the sadness of the days was good for us, and the few sun-rays of that end of autumn gladdened us all the more because they seemed weak and tired.
The wistaria is faded and the hawthorn dead; but this is the season of the heather in flower.
This evening, remember, and let the caressing wind bring you the perfumes of poor Campine.
Draw up your chair near mine, and stretch your hands out towards the hearth that I may see between your fingers the old flame burning; and watch the fire quietly with your eyes that fear no light, that they may be for me still franker when a quick and flashing ray strikes to their depths, illuminating them.
Oh! how beautiful and young still our life is when the clock rings out with its golden tone, and, coming closer, I brush you lightly and touch you, and a slow and gentle fever that neither desires to allay leads the sure and wondrous kiss from the hands to the forehead and from the forehead to the lips.
How I love you then, my bright beloved, in your welcoming, gently swooning body, that encircles me in its turn and dissolves me in its gladness! Everything becomes dearer to me--your mouth, your arms, your kindly breasts where my poor, tired forehead will lie quietly near your heart after the moment of riotous pleasure that you grant me.
For I love you still better after the sensual hour, when your goodness, still more steadfast and maternal, makes for me a soft repose, following sharp ardour, and when, after desire has cried out its violence, I hear approaching our regular happiness with steps so gentle that they are but silence.
Be once more merciful and cheering to us, light, pale brightness of winter that will bathe our brows when of an afternoon we both go into the garden to breathe in one last warmth.
We loved you long ago with so great a pride, with so great a love springing from our hearts, that one supreme and gentle and kindly flame is due to us at this hour when grief awaits us.
You are that which no man ever forgets, from the day when you first struck his victorious arms, and when, on the coming of evening, you slept in his eyes with your dead splendour and vanquished strength.
And for us you were always the visible fervour that, being everywhere diffused and shining in fevers of deep and stinging ardour, seemed to start for the infinite from our heart.
Alas! the days of the crimson phlox and of the proud roses that brightened its gates are far away, but however faded and withered it may be--what matters!--I love our garden still with all my heart.
Its distress is sometimes dearer and sweeter to me than was its gladness in the burning summer days.
Oh! the last perfume slowly rendered up by its last flower on its last mosses! I wandered this evening among its winding pathways, to touch with my earnest fingers all its plants; and falling on my knees amid the trembling grasses, I gave a long kiss to its damp and heavy soil.
And now let it die, and the mist and night come and spread over all; all my being seems to have entered into our garden's ruin, and, by understanding its death, I shall learn to know my own.
The evening falls, the moon is golden.
Before the day ends, go gaily into the garden and pluck with your gentle hands the few flowers that have not yet bowed sadly towards the earth.
Though their leaves may be wan, what matters! I admire them and you love them, and their petals are beautiful, in spite of all, on the stalks that bear them.
And you went away into the distance among the box-trees, along a monotonous path, and the nosegay that you plucked trembled in your hand and suddenly quivered; and then your dreaming fingers devoutly gathered together these glimmering autumn roses and wove them with tears into a pale and bright and supple crown.
The last light lit up your eyes, and your long step became sad and silent.
And slowly in the twilight you returned with empty hands to the house, leaving not far from our door, on a damp, low hillock, the white circle that your fingers had formed.
And I understood then that in the weary garden wherethrough the winds will soon pass like squadrons, you desired for the last time to adorn with flowers our youth that lies there dead.
When your hand, on an evening of the sluggish months, commits to the odorous cupboards the fruits of your orchard, I seem to see you calmly arranging our old perfumed and sweet-tasting memories.
And my relish for them returns, as it was in former years in the gold and the sun and with the wind on my lips; and then I see a thousand moments done and gone, and their gladness and their laughter and their cries and their fevers.
The past reawakens with so great a desire to be the present still, with its life and strength, that the hardly extinguished fires suddenly burn my body, and my heart rejoices to the point of swooning.
O beautiful luminous fruits in these autumn shadows, jewels fallen from the heavy necklace of russet summer, splendours that light up our monotonous hours, what a ruddy and spacious awakening you stir up in us! And now that the lofty leaves have fallen, that kept our garden sheltered beneath their shade, through the bare branches can be seen beyond them the roofs of the old villages climbing towards the horizon.
So long as summer poured out its gladness, none of us saw them grouped so near our door; but now that the flowers and the leaves are withered, we often brood on them with gentle thoughts.
Other people live there between stone walls, behind a worn threshold protected by a coping, having as sole friends but the wind and the rain and the lamp shining with its friendly light.
In the darkness at the fall of evening, when the fire awakens and the clock in which time swings is hushed, doubtless, as much as we, they love the silence, to feel themselves thinking through their eyes.
Nothing disturbs for them or for us those hours of deep and quiet and tender intimacy wherein the moment that was is blessed for having been, and of which the coming hour is always the best.
Indeed, how they also clench the old happiness, made up of pain and joy, within their trembling hands; they know each other's bodies that have grown old together, and each other's looks worn out by the same sorrows.
The roses of their life, they love them faded, with their dead glory and their last perfume and the heavy memory of their dead brightness falling away, leaf by leaf, in the garden of the years.
Against black winter, like hermits, they stay crouching within their human fervour, and nothing disheartens them and nothing leads them to complain of the days they no longer possess.
Oh! the quiet people in the depths of old villages! Indeed, do we not feel them neighbours of our heart! And do we not find in their eyes our tears and in their courage our strength and ardour! They are there beneath their roof, seated around fires, or lingering sometimes at their window-sill; and on this evening of spacious, floating wind, perhaps they have thought of us what we think of them.
When the starry sky covers our dwelling, we hush for hours before its intense and gentle fire, so that we may feel a greater and more fervent stirring within us.
The great silver stars follow their courses high up in the heavens; beneath the flames and the gleams, night spreads out its depths, and the calm is so great that the ocean listens! But what matters even the hushing of the sea, if in the brightness and immensity of space, full of invisible violence, our hearts beat so strongly that they make all the silence? With the same love that you were for me long ago a garden of splendour whose wavering coppices shaded the long grass and the docile roses, you are for me in these black days a calm and steadfast sanctuary.
All is centred there: your fervour and your brightness and your movements assembling the flowers of your goodness; but all is drawn together closely in a deep peace against the sharp winds piercing the winter of the world.
My happiness keeps warm there within your folded arms; your pretty, artless words, in their gladness and familiarity, sing still with as great a charm to my ears as in the days of the white lilac or of the red currants.
Oh! I feel your gay and shining cheerfulness triumphing day by day over the sorrow of the years, and you yourself smile at the silver threads that slip their waving network into your glossy hair.
When your head bends to my deep-felt kiss, what does it matter to me that your brow is furrowed, and that your hands are becoming ridged with hard veins when I hold them between my two steadfast hands! You never complain, and you believe firmly that nothing true dies when love receives its meed, and that the living fire on which our soul feeds consumes even grief to increase its flame.
The flowers of bright welcome along the wall await us no longer when we go indoors, and our silken ponds whose smooth waters chafe lie outstretched no more beneath pure, soft skies.
All the birds have fled our monotonous plains, and pallid fogs float over the marshes.
O those two cries: autumn, winter! winter, autumn! Do you hear the dead wood falling in the forest? No more is our garden the husband of light, whence the phlox were seen springing towards their glory; our fiery gladioli are mingled with the earth, and have lain down in their length to die.
Everything is nerveless and void of beauty; everything is flameless and passes and flees and bends and sinks down unsupported.
Oh! give me your eyes lit up by your soul that I may seek in them in spite of all a corner of the old sky.
In them alone our light lives still, the light that covered all the garden long ago, when it exulted with the white pride of our lilies and the climbing ardour of our hollyhocks.
When the fine snow with its sparkling grains silts over our threshold, I hear your footsteps wander and stop in the neighbouring room.
You withdraw the bright and fragile mirror from its place by the window, and your bunch of keys dances along the drawer of the beech-wood wardrobe.
I listen, and you are poking the fire and arousing the embers; and you are arranging about the silent walls the silence of the chairs.
You remove the fleeting dust from the workbasket with the narrow feet, and your ring strikes and resounds on the quivering sides of a wine-glass.
And I am more happy than ever this evening at your tender presence, and at feeling you near and not seeing you and ever hearing you.
If fate has saved us from commonplace errors and from vile untruth and from sorry shams, it is because all constraint that might have bowed our double fervour revolted us.
You went your way, free and frank and bright, mingling with the flowers of love the flowers of your will, and gently lifting up towards yourself its lofty spirit when my brow was bent towards fear or doubt.
And you were always kind and artless in your acts, knowing that my heart was for ever yours; for if I loved--do I now know?--some other woman, it is to your heart that I always returned.
Your eyes were then so pure in their tears that my being was stirred to sincerity and truth; and I repeated to you holy and gentle words, and your weapons were sadness and forgiveness.
And in the evening I lulled my head to sleep on your bright bosom, happy at having returned from false and dim distances to the fragrant spring that bore sway in us, and I remained a captive in your open arms.
No, my heart has never tired of you.
In the time of June, long ago, you said to me: "If I knew, friend, if I knew that my presence one day might be a burden to you-- with my poor heart and sorrowful thoughts, I would go away, no matter where." And gently your forehead rose towards my kiss.
And you said to me again: "Bonds loosen always and life is so full, and what matters if the chain is golden that ties to the same ring in port our two human barks!" And gently your tears revealed to me your grief.
And you said and you said again: "Let us separate, let us separate before the evil days; our life has been too lofty to drag it trivially from fault to fault." And you fled and you fled, and my two hands desperately held you back.
No, my heart has never tired of you.
How happy we are still and proud of living when the least ray of sunshine glimpsed in the heavens lights up for a moment the poor flowers of rime that the hard and delicate frost engraved on our window-panes.
Rapture leaps in us and hope carries us away, and our old garden appears to us again, in spite of its long paths strewn with dead branches, living and pure and bright and full of golden gleams.
Something shining and undaunted, I know not what, creeps into our blood; and in the quick kisses that, ardently, frantically, we give each other, we re-embody the immensity and fulness of summer.
Shall we suffer, alas! the dead weight of the years until at length we are no more than two quiet people, exchanging the harmless kisses of children at evening when the fire flames in the hollow of the chimney? Shall our dear furniture see us drag ourselves with slow steps from the hearth to the beechen chest, support ourselves by the wall to reach the window, and huddle our tottering bodies on heavy seats? If our wreck is to appear one day in such guise, while numbness deadens our brains and our arms, we shall not bemoan, in spite of evil fate, and we shall hold our tears pent up in our breasts.
For even so, we shall still keep our eyes with which to gaze on the day that follows night, and to see the dawn and the sun shed their radiance on life, and make a wonderful object of the earth.
The small happenings, the thousand nothings, a letter, a date, a humble anniversary, a word said once again as in days long ago uplift your heart and mine in these long evenings.
And we celebrate for ourselves these simple things, and we count and recount our old treasures, so that the little of us that we still keep may remain steadfast and brave before the sullen hour.
And more than is fitting, we show ourselves solicitous of these poor, gentle, kindly joys that sit down on the bench near the flaming fire with winter flowers on their thin knees.
And they take from the chest where their goodness hides it the bright bread of happiness that was allotted to us, and of which Love in our house has so long eaten that he loves it even to the crumbs.
Come even to our threshold, scattering your white ash, O peaceful, slowly falling snow: the lime-tree in the garden holds all its branches bowed, and the light calandra dissolves in the sky no longer.
O snow, who warm and protect the barely rising corn with the moss and wool that you spread from plain to plain! Silent snow, the gentle friend of the houses asleep in the calm of morning: Cover our roof and lightly touch our windows, and suddenly enter by the door over the threshold with your pure flakes and your dancing flames, O snow, luminous through our soul, snow, who also warm our last dreams like the rising corn! When our bright garden was gay with all its flowers, the regret at having shrunk our hearts sprang from our lips in moments of passion; and forgiveness, offered but deserved always, and the exaggerated display of our wretchedness and so many tears moistening our sad, sincere eyes uplifted our love.
But in these months of heavy rain, when everything huddles together and makes itself small, when brightness itself tires of thrusting back shadow and night, our soul is no longer vibrant and strong enough to confess our faults with rapture.
We tell them in slow speech; in truth, with affection still, but at the fall of the evening and no longer at dawn; sometimes even we count them on our ten fingers like things that we number and arrange in the house, and to lessen their folly or their number we debate them.
With my old hands lifted to your forehead, during your brief sleep by the black hearth this evening, I part your hair, and I kiss the fervour of your eyes hidden beneath your long lashes.
Oh! the sweet affection of this day's end! My eyes follow the years that have completed their course, and suddenly your life appears so perfect in them that my love is moved by a touching respect.
And as in the time when you were my betrothed, the desire comes back to me again in all its ardour to fall on my knees, and with fingers as chaste as my thoughts to touch the place where your gentle heart beats.
If our hearts have burned in uplifting days with a love as bright as it was lofty, age now makes us slack and indulgent and mild before our faults.
You no longer make us greater, O youthful will, with your unsubdued ardour, and our life is coloured now with gentle calm and pale kindliness.
We are at the setting of your sun, love, and we mask our weakness with the common-place words and poor speeches of an empty, tardy wisdom.
Oh! how sad and shameful would the future be for us if from our winter and our mistiness there did not break out like a torch the memory of the high-spirited souls we once were.
In this rugged winter when the floating sun founders on the horizon like a heavy wreck, I love to say your name, with its slow, solemn tone, as the clock echoes with the deep strokes of time.
And the more I say it, the more ravished is my voice, so much so that from my lips it descends into my heart and awakens in me a more glowing happiness than the sweetest words I have spoken in my life.
And before the new dawn or the evening falling to sleep, I repeat it with my voice that is ever the same, but oh! with what strength and supreme ardour shall I pronounce it at the hour of death! Perhaps, when my last day comes, perhaps, if only for a moment, a frail and quavering sun will stoop down at my window.
My hands then, my poor faded hands, will even so be gilded once again by his glory; he will touch my mouth and my forehead a last time with his slow, bright, deep kiss; and the pale, but still proud flowers of my eyes will return his light before they close.
Sun, have I not worshipped your strength and your brightness! My torrid, gentle art, in its supreme achievement has held you captive in the heart of my poems; like a field of ripe wheat that surges in the summer wind, this page and that of my books confers life on you and exhalts you: O Sun, who bring forth and deliver, O immense friend of whom our pride has need, be it that at the new, solemn and imperious hour when my old human heart will be heavy under the proof, you will come once more to visit it and witness.
Oh! how gentle are your hands and their slow caress winding about my neck and gliding over my body, when I tell you at the fall of evening how my strength grows heavy day by day with the lead of my weakness! You do not wish me to become a shadow and a wreck like those who go towards the darkness, even though they carry a laurel in their mournful hands and fame sleeping in their hollow chest.
Oh! how you soften the law of time for me, and how comforting and generous to me is your dream; for the first time, with an untruth you lull my heart, that forgives you and thanks you for it, Well knowing, nevertheless, that all ardour is vain against all that is and all that must be, and that, by finishing in your eyes my fine human life, may perhaps be found a deep happiness.
When you have closed my eyes to the light, kiss them with a long kiss, for they will have given you in the last look of their last fervour the utmost passionate love.
Beneath the still radiance of the funeral torch, bend down towards the farewell in them your sad and beautiful face, so that the only image they will keep in the tomb may be imprinted on them and may endure.
And let me feel, before the coffin is nailed up, our hands meet once again on the pure, white bed, and your cheek rest one last time against my forehead on the pale cushions.
And let me afterwards go far away with my heart, which will preserve so fiery a love for you that the other dead will feel its glow even through the compact, dead earth!
If ever two were one, then surely we.
If ever man were loved by wife, then thee.
If ever wife was happy in a man,
Compare with me, ye women, if you can.
I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold,
Or all the riches that the East doth hold.
My love is such that rivers cannot quench,
Nor ought but love from thee give recompense.
Thy love is such I can no way repay;
The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.
Then while we live, in love let’s so persever,
That when we live no more, we may live ever.
Busy old fool, unruly sun,
Why dost thou thus,
Through windows, and through curtains call on us?
Must to thy motions lovers' seasons run?
Saucy pedantic wretch, go chide
Late school boys and sour prentices,
Go tell court huntsmen that the king will ride,
Call country ants to harvest offices,
Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,
Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time.
Thy beams, so reverend and strong
Why shouldst thou think?
I could eclipse and cloud them with a wink,
But that I would not lose her sight so long;
If her eyes have not blinded thine,
Look, and tomorrow late, tell me,
Whether both th' Indias of spice and mine
Be where thou leftst them, or lie here with me.
Ask for those kings whom thou saw'st yesterday,
And thou shalt hear, All here in one bed lay.
She's all states, and all princes, I,
Nothing else is.
Princes do but play us; compared to this,
All honor's mimic, all wealth alchemy.
Thou, sun, art half as happy as we,
In that the world's contracted thus.
Thine age asks ease, and since thy duties be
To warm the world, that's done in warming us.
Shine here to us, and thou art everywhere;
This bed thy center is, these walls, thy sphere.
Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all:
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call—
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.
Then if for my love thou my love receivest,
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;
But yet be blamed if thou this self deceivest
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.
I do forgive thy robb’ry, gentle thief,
Although thou steal thee all my poverty;
And yet love knows it is a greater grief
To bear love’s wrong than hate’s known injury.
Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
Kill me with spites, yet we must not be foes.
Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea
But sad mortality o’er-sways their power,
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
O, how shall summer’s honey breath hold out
Against the wrackful siege of batt’ring days,
When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
Nor gates of steel so strong, but time decays?
O fearful meditation! where, alack,
Shall time’s best jewel from time’s chest lie hid?
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
O, none, unless this miracle have might,
That in black ink my love may still shine bright.
Drink to me only with thine eyes,
And I will pledge with mine;
Or leave a kiss but in the cup,
And I’ll not look for wine.
The thirst that from the soul doth rise
Doth ask a drink divine;
But might I of Jove’s nectar sup,
I would not change for thine.
I sent thee late a rosy wreath,
Not so much honouring thee
As giving it a hope, that there
It could not withered be.
But thou thereon didst only breathe,
And sent’st it back to me;
Since when it grows, and smells, I swear,
Not of itself, but thee.
A glimpse through an interstice caught,
Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar-room around the stove late of a winter night, and I unremark’d seated in a corner,
Of a youth who loves me and whom I love, silently approaching and seating himself near, that he may hold me by the hand,
A long while amid the noises of coming and going, of drinking and oath and smutty jest,
There we two, content, happy in being together, speaking little, perhaps not a word.
I love your lips when they’re wet with wine
And red with a wild desire;
I love your eyes when the lovelight lies
Lit with a passionate fire.
I love your arms when the warm white flesh
Touches mine in a fond embrace;
I love your hair when the strands enmesh
Your kisses against my face.
Not for me the cold, calm kiss
Of a virgin’s bloodless love;
Not for me the saint’s white bliss,
Nor the heart of a spotless dove.
But give me the love that so freely gives
And laughs at the whole world’s blame,
With your body so young and warm in my arms,
It sets my poor heart aflame.
So kiss me sweet with your warm wet mouth,
Still fragrant with ruby wine,
And say with a fervor born of the South
That your body and soul are mine.
Clasp me close in your warm young arms,
While the pale stars shine above,
And we’ll live our whole young lives away
In the joys of a living love.
Every night, we couldn’t sleep.
Our upstairs neighbors had to keep
Dropping something down the hall—
A barbell or a bowling ball,
And from the window by the bed,
Echoing inside my head,
Alley cats expended breath
In arias of love and death.
Dawn again, across the street,
Jackhammers began to beat
Like hangovers, and you would frown—
That well-built house, why tear it down?
Noon, the radiator grill
Groaned, gave off a lesser chill
So that we could take off our coats.
The pipes coughed to clear their throats.
Our nerves were frayed like ravelled sleeves,
We cherished each our minor griefs
To keep them warm until the night,
When it was time again to fight;
But we were young, did not need much
To make us laugh instead, and touch,
And could not hear ourselves above
The arias of death and love.
I loved you first: but afterwards your love
Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song
As drowned the friendly cooings of my dove.
Which owes the other most? my love was long,
And yours one moment seemed to wax more strong;
I loved and guessed at you, you construed me
And loved me for what might or might not be –
Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong.
For verily love knows not ‘mine’ or ‘thine;’
With separate ‘I’ and ‘thou’ free love has done,
For one is both and both are one in love:
Rich love knows nought of ‘thine that is not mine;’
Both have the strength and both the length thereof,
Both of us, of the love which makes us one.
You are like me, you will die too, but not today:
you, incommensurate, therefore the hours shine:
if I say to you “To you I say,” you have not been
set to music, or broadcast live on the ghost
radio, may never be an oil painting or
Old Master’s charcoal sketch: you are
a concordance of person, number, voice,
and place, strawberries spread through your name
as if it were budding shrubs, how you remind me
of some spring, the waters as cool and clear
(late rain clings to your leaves, shaken by light wind),
which is where you occur in grassy moonlight:
and you are a lily, an aster, white trillium
or viburnum, by all rights mine, white star
in the meadow sky, the snow still arriving
from its earthwards journeys, here where there is
no snow (I dreamed the snow was you,
when there was snow), you are my right,
have come to be my night (your body takes on
the dimensions of sleep, the shape of sleep
becomes you): and you fall from the sky
with several flowers, words spill from your mouth
in waves, your lips taste like the sea, salt-sweet (trees
and seas have flown away, I call it
loving you): home is nowhere, therefore you,
a kind of dwell and welcome, song after all,
and free of any eden we can name
You have changed me already. I am a fireball
That is hurtling towards the sky to where you are
You can choose not to look up but I am a giant orange ball
That is throwing sparks upon your face
Oh look at them shake
Upon you like a great planet that has been murdered by change
O too this is so dramatic this shaking
Of my great planet that is bigger than you thought it would be
So you ran and hid
Under a large tree. She was graceful, I think
That tree although soon she will wither
Into ten black snakes upon your throat
And when she does I will be wandering as I always am
A graceful lady that is part museum
Of the voices of the universe everyone else forgets
I will hold your voice in a little box
And when you come upon me I won’t look back at you
You will feel a hand upon your heart while I place your voice back
Into the heart from where it came from
And I will not cry also
Although you will expect me to
I was wiser too than you had expected
For I knew all along you were mine
The shine on her buckle took precedence in sun
Her shine, I should say, could take me anywhere
It feels right to be up this close in tight wind
It feels right to notice all the shiny things about you
About you there is nothing I wouldn’t want to know
With you nothing is simple yet nothing is simpler
About you many good things come into relation
I think of proofs and grammar, vowel sounds, like
A is for knee socks, E for panties
I is for buttondown, O the blouse you wear
U is for hair clip, and Y your tight skirt
The music picks up again, I am the man I hope to be
The bright air hangs freely near your newly cut hair
It is so easy now to see gravity at work in your face
Easy to understand time, that dark process
To accept it as a beautiful process, your face
love is more thicker than forget
more thinner than recall
more seldom than a wave is wet
more frequent than to fail
it is most mad and moonly
and less it shall unbe
than all the sea which only
is deeper than the sea
love is less always than to win
less never than alive
less bigger than the least begin
less littler than forgive
it is most sane and sunly
and more it cannot die
than all the sky which only
is higher than the sky
They flee from me that sometime did me seek
With naked foot, stalking in my chamber.
I have seen them gentle, tame, and meek,
That now are wild and do not remember
That sometime they put themself in danger
To take bread at my hand; and now they range,
Busily seeking with a continual change.
Thanked be fortune it hath been otherwise
Twenty times better; but once in special,
In thin array after a pleasant guise,
When her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,
And she me caught in her arms long and small;
Therewithall sweetly did me kiss
And softly said, “Dear heart, how like you this?”
It was no dream: I lay broad waking.
But all is turned thorough my gentleness
Into a strange fashion of forsaking;
And I have leave to go of her goodness,
And she also, to use newfangleness.
But since that I so kindly am served
I would fain know what she hath deserved.
I gave you sorrow to hang on your wall
Like a calendar in one color.
I wear a torn place on my sleeve.
It isn’t as simple as that.
Between no place of mine and no place of yours
You’d have thought I’d know the way by now
Just from thinking it over.
Oh I know
I’ve no excuse to be stuck here turning
Like a mirror on a string,
Except it’s hardly credible how
It all keeps changing.
Loss has a wider choice of directions
Than the other thing.
As if I had a system
I shuffle among the lies
Turning them over, if only
I could be sure what I’d lost.
I uncover my footprints, I
Poke them till the eyes open.
They don’t recall what it looked like.
When was I using it last?
Was it like a ring or a light
Or the autumn pond
Which chokes and glitters but
Grows colder?
It could be all in the mind.Anyway
Nothing seems to bring it back to me.
And I’ve been to see
Your hands as trees borne away on a flood,
The same film over and over,
And an old one at that, shattering its account
To the last of the digits, and nothing
And the blank end.
The lightning has shown me the scars of the future.
I’ve had a long look at someone
Alone like a key in a lock
Without what it takes to turn.
It isn’t as simple as that.
Winter will think back to your lit harvest
For which there is no help, and the seed
Of eloquence will open its wings
When you are gone.
But at this moment
When the nails are kissing the fingers good-bye
And my only
Chance is bleeding from me,
When my one chance is bleeding,
For speaking either truth or comfort
I have no more tongue than a wound.
Our embrace lasted too long.
We loved right down to the bone.
I hear the bones grind, I see
our two skeletons.
Now I am waiting
till you leave, till
the clatter of your shoes
is heard no more. Now, silence.
Tonight I am going to sleep alone
on the bedclothes of purity.
Aloneness
is the first hygienic measure.
Aloneness
will enlarge the walls of the room,
I will open the window
and the large, frosty air will enter,
healthy as tragedy.
Human thoughts will enter
and human concerns,
misfortune of others, saintliness of others.
They will converse softly and sternly.
Do not come anymore.
I am an animal
very rarely.
The time is come, I must depart
from thee, ah famous city;
I never yet to rue my smart,
did find that thou had’st pity.
Wherefore small cause there is, that I
should grieve from thee to go;
But many women foolishly,
like me, and other moe,
Do such a fixèd fancy set,
on those which least deserve,
That long it is ere wit we get 
away from them to swerve.
But time with pity oft will tell 
to those that will her try,
Whether it best be more to mell,
or utterly defy.
And now hath time me put in mind
of thy great cruelness,
That never once a help would find,
to ease me in distress.
Thou never yet would’st credit give
to board me for a year;
Nor with apparel me relieve,
except thou payèd were.
No, no, thou never did’st me good,
nor ever wilt, I know.
Yet am I in no angry mood,
but will, or ere I go,
In perfect love and charity,
my testament here write,
And leave to thee such treasury,
as I in it recite.
Now stand aside and give me leave
to write my latest will;
And see that none you do deceive
of that I leave them till.
We stood by a pond that winter day,
And the sun was white, as though chidden of God,
And a few leaves lay on the starving sod;
– They had fallen from an ash, and were gray.
Your eyes on me were as eyes that rove
Over tedious riddles of years ago;
And some words played between us to and fro
On which lost the more by our love.
The smile on your mouth was the deadest thing
Alive enough to have strength to die;
And a grin of bitterness swept thereby
Like an ominous bird a-wing….
Since then, keen lessons that love deceives,
And wrings with wrong, have shaped to me
Your face, and the God curst sun, and a tree,
And a pond edged with grayish leaves.
How love came in I do not know,
Whether by the eye, or ear, or no;
Or whether with the soul it came
(At first) infused with the same;
Whether in part ’tis here or there,
Or, like the soul, whole everywhere,
This troubles me: but I as well
As any other this can tell:
That when from hence she does depart
The outlet then is from the heart.
I don’t love you as if you were a rose of salt, topaz, 
or arrow of carnations that propagate fire: 
I love you as one loves certain obscure things, 
secretly, between the shadow and the soul.
I love you as the plant that doesn’t bloom but carries 
the light of those flowers, hidden, within itself, 
and thanks to your love the tight aroma that arose 
from the earth lives dimly in my body.
I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where, 
I love you directly without problems or pride:
I love you like this because I don’t know any other way to love,
except in this form in which I am not nor are you, 
so close that your hand upon my chest is mine, 
so close that your eyes close with my dreams.
I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where.
I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close.
I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul.
so I wait for you like a lonely house till you will see me again and live in me.
Till then my windows ache.
In this part of the story I am the one who dies, the only one, and I will die of love because I love you, because I love you, Love, in fire and in blood.
I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where, I love you simply, without problems or pride:
I love you in this way because I don’t know any other way of loving.
By this he knew she wept with waking eyes:
That, at his hand's light quiver by her head,
The strange low sobs that shook their common bed
Were called into her with a sharp surprise,
And strangled mute, like little gaping snakes,
Dreadfully venomous to him. She lay
Stone-still, and the long darkness flowed away
With muffled pulses. Then, as midnight makes
Her giant heart of Memory and Tears
Drink the pale drug of silence, and so beat
Sleep's heavy measure, they from head to feet
Were moveless, looking through their dead black years,
By vain regret scrawled over the blank wall.
Like sculptured effigies they might be seen
Upon their marriage-tomb, the sword between;
Each wishing for the sword that severs all.
It ended, and the morrow brought the task.
Her eyes were guilty gates, that let him in
By shutting all too zealous for their sin:
Each sucked a secret, and each wore a mask.
But, oh, the bitter taste her beauty had
He sickened as at breath of poison-flowers:
A languid humour stole among the hours,
And if their smiles encountered, he went mad,
And raged deep inward, till the light was brown
Before his vision, and the world forgot,
Looked wicked as some old dull murder-spot.
A star with lurid beams, she seemed to crown
The pit of infamy: and then again
He fainted on his vengefulness, and strove
To ape the magnanimity of love,
And smote himself, a shuddering heap of pain.
This was the woman; what now of the man?
But pass him. If he comes beneath a heel,
He shall be crushed until he cannot feel,
Or, being callous, haply till he can.
But he is nothing:--nothing? Only mark
The rich light striking out from her on him!
Ha! what a sense it is when her eyes swim
Across the man she singles, leaving dark
All else! Lord God, who mad'st the thing so fair,
See that I am drawn to her even now!
It cannot be such harm on her cool brow
To put a kiss? Yet if I meet him there!
But she is mine! Ah, no! I know too well
I claim a star whose light is overcast:
I claim a phantom-woman in the Past.
The hour has struck, though I heard not the bell!
All other joys of life he strove to warm,
And magnify, and catch them to his lip:
But they had suffered shipwreck with the ship,
And gazed upon him sallow from the storm.
Or if Delusion came, 'twas but to show
The coming minute mock the one that went.
Cold as a mountain in its star-pitched tent,
Stood high Philosophy, less friend than foe:
Whom self-caged Passion, from its prison-bars,
Is always watching with a wondering hate.
Not till the fire is dying in the grate,
Look we for any kinship with the stars.
Oh, wisdom never comes when it is gold,
And the great price we pay for it full worth:
We have it only when we are half earth.
Little avails that coinage to the old!
A message from her set his brain aflame.
A world of household matters filled her mind,
Wherein he saw hypocrisy designed:
She treated him as something that is tame,
And but at other provocation bites.
Familiar was her shoulder in the glass,
Through that dark rain: yet it may come to pass
That a changed eye finds such familiar sights
More keenly tempting than new loveliness.
The 'What has been' a moment seemed his own:
The splendours, mysteries, dearer because known,
Nor less divine: Love's inmost sacredness
Called to him, 'Come!'--In his restraining start,
Eyes nurtured to be looked at, scarce could see
A wave of the great waves of Destiny
Convulsed at a checked impulse of the heart.
It chanced his lips did meet her forehead cool.
She had no blush, but slanted down her eye.
Shamed nature, then, confesses love can die:
And most she punishes the tender fool
Who will believe what honours her the most!
Dead! is it dead? She has a pulse, and flow
Of tears, the price of blood-drops, as I know,
For whom the midnight sobs around Love's ghost,
Since then I heard her, and so will sob on.
The love is here; it has but changed its aim.
O bitter barren woman! what's the name?
The name, the name, the new name thou hast won?
Behold me striking the world's coward stroke!
That will I not do, though the sting is dire.
Beneath the surface this, while by the fire
They sat, she laughing at a quiet joke.
She issues radiant from her dressing-room,
Like one prepared to scale an upper sphere:
--By stirring up a lower, much I fear
How deftly that oiled barber lays his bloom
That long-shanked dapper Cupid with frisked curls
Can make known women torturingly fair;
The gold-eyed serpent dwelling in rich hair,
Awakes beneath his magic whisks and twirls.
His art can take the eyes from out my head,
Until I see with eyes of other men;
While deeper knowledge crouches in its den,
And sends a spark up:--is it true we are wed?
Yea! filthiness of body is most vile,
But faithlessness of heart I do hold worse.
The former, it were not so great a curse
To read on the steel-mirror of her smile.
Yet it was plain she struggled, and that salt
Of righteous feeling made her pitiful.
Poor twisting worm, so queenly beautiful!
Where came the cleft between us? whose the fault?
My tears are on thee, that have rarely dropped
As balm for any bitter wound of mine:
My breast will open for thee at a sign!
But, no: we are two reed-pipes, coarsely stopped:
The God once filled them with his mellow breath;
And they were music till he flung them down,
Used! used! Hear now the discord-loving clown
Puff his gross spirit in them, worse than death
I do not know myself without thee more:
In this unholy battle I grow base:
If the same soul be under the same face,
Speak, and a taste of that old time restore
He felt the wild beast in him betweenwhiles
So masterfully rude, that he would grieve
To see the helpless delicate thing receive
His guardianship through certain dark defiles.
Had he not teeth to rend, and hunger too?
But still he spared her. Once: 'Have you no fear ?'
He said: 'twas dusk; she in his grasp; none near.
She laughed: 'No, surely; am I not with you?'
And uttering that soft starry 'you,' she leaned
Her gentle body near him, looking up;
And from her eyes, as from a poison-cup,
He drank until the flittering eyelids screened.
Devilish malignant witch and oh, young beam
Of heaven's circle-glory! Here thy shape
To squeeze like an intoxicating grape
I might, and yet thou goest safe, supreme.
But where began the change; and what's my crime?
The wretch condemned, who has not been arraigned,
Chafes at his sentence. Shall I, unsustained,
Drag on Love's nerveless body thro' all time?
I must have slept, since now I wake. Prepare,
You lovers, to know Love a thing of moods:
Not like hard life, of laws. In Love's deep woods,
I dreamt of loyal Life:--the offence is there!
Love's jealous woods about the sun are curled;
At least, the sun far brighter there did beam.
My crime is, that the puppet of a dream,
I plotted to be worthy of the world.
Oh, had I with my darling helped to mince
The facts of life, you still had seen me go
With hindward feather and with forward toe,
Her much-adored delightful Fairy Prince!
Out in the yellow meadows, where the bee
Hums by us with the honey of the Spring,
And showers of sweet notes from the larks on wing,
Are dropping like a noon-dew, wander we.
Or is it now? or was it then? for now,
As then, the larks from running rings pour showers:
The golden foot of May is on the flowers,
And friendly shadows dance upon her brow.
What's this, when Nature swears there is no change
To challenge eyesight? Now, as then, the grace
Of heaven seems holding earth in its embrace.
Nor eyes, nor heart, has she to feel it strange?
Look, woman, in the West. There wilt thou see
An amber cradle near the sun's decline:
Within it, featured even in death divine,
Is lying a dead infant, slain by thee.
Not solely that the Future she destroys,
And the fair life which in the distance lies
For all men, beckoning out from dim rich skies:
Nor that the passing hour's supporting joys
Have lost the keen-edged flavour, which begat
Distinction in old times, and still should breed
Sweet Memory, and Hope,--earth's modest seed,
And heaven's high-prompting: not that the world is flat
Since that soft-luring creature I embraced,
Among the children of Illusion went:
Methinks with all this loss I were content,
If the mad Past, on which my foot is based,
Were firm, or might be blotted: but the whole
Of life is mixed: the mocking Past will stay:
And if I drink oblivion of a day,
So shorten I the stature of my soul.
'I play for Seasons; not Eternities!'
Says Nature, laughing on her way. 'So must
All those whose stake is nothing more than dust!'
And lo, she wins, and of her harmonies
She is full sure! Upon her dying rose,
She drops a look of fondness, and goes by,
Scarce any retrospection in her eye;
For she the laws of growth most deeply knows,
Whose hands bear, here, a seed-bag--there, an urn.
Pledges she herself to aught, 'twould mark her end!
This lesson of our only visible friend,
Can we not teach our foolish hearts to learn ?
Yes! yes !--but, oh, our human rose is fair
Surpassingly! Lose calmly Love's great bliss,
When the renewed for ever of a kiss
Whirls life within the shower of loosened hair!
What soul would bargain for a cure that brings
Contempt the nobler agony to kill?
Rather let me bear on the bitter ill,
And strike this rusty bosom with new stings!
It seems there is another veering fit,
Since on a gold-haired lady's eyeballs pure,
I looked with little prospect of a cure,
The while her mouth's red bow loosed shafts of wit.
Just heaven! can it be true that jealousy
Has decked the woman thus? and does her head
Swim somewhat for possessions forfeited?
Madam, you teach me many things that be.
I open an old book, and there I find
That 'Women still may love whom they deceive?'
Such love I prize not, madam: by your leave,
The game you play at is not to my mind.
I think she sleeps: it must be sleep, when low
Hangs that abandoned arm toward the floor;
The face turned with it. Now make fast the door.
Sleep on: it is your husband, not your foe.
The Poet's black stage-lion of wronged love,
Frights not our modern dames:--well if he did!
Now will I pour new light upon that lid,
Full-sloping like the breasts beneath. 'Sweet dove,
Your sleep is pure. Nay, pardon: I disturb.
I do not? good!' Her waking infant-stare
Grows woman to the burden my hands bear:
Her own handwriting to me when no curb
Was left on Passion's tongue. She trembles through;
A woman's tremble--the whole instrument:--
I show another letter lately sent.
The words are very like: the name is new.
In our old shipwrecked days there was an hour,
When in the firelight steadily aglow,
Joined slackly, we beheld the red chasm grow
Among the clicking coals. Our library-bower
That eve was left to us: and hushed we sat
As lovers to whom Time is whispering.
From sudden-opened doors we heard them sing:
The nodding elders mixed good wine with chat.
Well knew we that Life's greatest treasure lay
With us, and of it was our talk. 'Ah, yes
Love dies !' I said: I never thought it less.
She yearned to me that sentence to unsay.
Then when the fire domed blackening, I found
Her cheek was salt against my kiss, and swift
Up the sharp scale of sobs her breast did lift:
Now am I haunted by that taste! that sound!
At dinner, she is hostess, I am host.
Went the feast ever cheerfuller ? She keeps
The Topic over intellectual deeps
In buoyancy afloat. They see no ghost.
With sparkling surface-eyes we ply the ball:
It is in truth a most contagious game:
HIDING THE SKELETON, shall be its name.
Such play as this the devils might appal!
But here's the greater wonder; in that we,
Enamoured of an acting nought can tire,
Each other, like true hypocrites, admire;
Warm-lighted looks, Love's ephemerioe,
Shoot gaily o'er the dishes and the wine.
We waken envy of our happy lot.
Fast, sweet, and golden, shows the marriage-knot.
Dear guests, you now have seen Love's corpse-light shine.
Here Jack and Tom are paired with Moll and Meg.
Curved open to the river-reach is seen
A country merry-making on the green.
Fair space for signal shakings of the leg.
That little screwy fiddler from his booth,
Whence flows one nut-brown stream, commands the joints
Of all who caper here at various points.
I have known rustic revels in my youth:
The May-fly pleasures of a mind at ease.
An early goddess was a county lass:
A charmed Amphion-oak she tripped the grass.
What life was that I lived? The life of these?
Heaven keep them happy! Nature they seem near.
They must, I think, be wiser than I am;
They have the secret of the bull and lamb.
'Tis true that when we trace its source, 'tis beer.
No state is enviable. To the luck alone
Of some few favoured men I would put claim.
I bleed, but her who wounds I will not blame.
Have I not felt her heart as 'twere my own
Beat thro' me? could I hurt her? heaven and hell!
But I could hurt her cruelly! Can I let
My Love's old time-piece to another set,
Swear it can't stop, and must for ever swell?
Sure, that's one way Love drifts into the mart
Where goat-legged buyers throng. I see not plain:--
My meaning is, it must not be again.
Great God! the maddest gambler throws his heart.
If any state be enviable on earth,
'Tis yon born idiot's, who, as days go by,
Still rubs his hands before him, like a fly,
In a queer sort of meditative mirth.
I am not of those miserable males
Who sniff at vice, and, daring not to snap,
Do therefore hope for heaven. I take the hap
Of all my deeds. The wind that fills my sails,
Propels; but I am helmsman. Am I wrecked,
I know the devil has sufficient weight
To bear: I lay it not on him, or fate.
Besides, he's damned. That man I do suspect
A coward, who would burden the poor deuce
With what ensues from his own slipperiness.
I have just found a wanton-scented tress
In an old desk, dusty for lack of use.
Of days and nights it is demonstrative,
That, like some aged star, gleam luridly.
If for those times I must ask charity,
Have I not any charity to give?
We three are on the cedar-shadowed lawn;
My friend being third. He who at love once laughed,
Is in the weak rib by a fatal shaft
Struck through, and tells his passion's bashful dawn
And radiant culmination, glorious crown,
When 'this' she said: went 'thus': most wondrous she.
Our eyes grow white, encountering that we are three,
Forgetful; then together we look down.
But he demands our blessing; is convinced
That words of wedded lovers must bring good.
We question; if we dare! or if we should!
And pat him, with light laugh. We have not winced.
Next, she has fallen. Fainting points the sign
To happy things in wedlock. When she wakes,
She looks the star that thro' the cedar shakes:
Her lost moist hand clings mortally to mine.
What may the woman labour to confess?
There is about her mouth a nervous twitch.
'Tis something to be told, or hidden:--which?
I get a glimpse of hell in this mild guess.
She has desires of touch, as if to feel
That all the household things are things she knew.
She stops before the glass. What sight in view?
A face that seems the latest to reveal!
For she turns from it hastily, and tossed
Irresolute, steals shadow-like to where
I stand; and wavering pale before me there,
Her tears fall still as oak-leaves after frost.
She will not speak. I will not ask. We are
League-sundered by the silent gulf between.
You burly lovers on the village green,
Yours is a lower, and a happier star!
'Tis Christmas weather, and a country house
Receives us: rooms are full: we can but get
An attic-crib. Such lovers will not fret
At that, it is half-said. The great carouse
Knocks hard upon the midnight's hollow door,
But when I knock at hers, I see the pit.
Why did I come here in that dullard fit?
I enter, and lie couched upon the floor.
Passing, I caught the coverlet's quick beat:--
Come, Shame, burn to my soul! and Pride, and Pain--
Foul demons that have tortured me, enchain!
Out in the freezing darkness the lambs bleat.
The small bird stiffens in the low starlight.
I know not how, but shuddering as I slept,
I dreamed a banished angel to me crept:
My feet were nourished on her breasts all night.
The misery is greater, as I live!
To know her flesh so pure, so keen her sense,
That she does penance now for no offence,
Save against Love. The less can I forgive!
The less can I forgive, though I adore
That cruel lovely pallor which surrounds
Her footsteps; and the low vibrating sounds
That come on me, as from a magic shore.
Low are they, but most subtle to find out
The shrinking soul. Madam, 'tis understood
When women play upon their womanhood;
It means, a Season gone. And yet I doubt
But I am duped. That nun-like look waylays
My fancy. Oh! I do but wait a sign!
Pluck out the eyes of pride! thy mouth to mine!
Never! though I die thirsting. Go thy ways!
You like not that French novel? Tell me why.
You think it quite unnatural. Let us see.
The actors are, it seems, the usual three:
Husband, and wife, and lover. She--but fie!
In England we'll not hear of it. Edmond,
The lover, her devout chagrin doth share;
Blanc-mange and absinthe are his penitent fare,
Till his pale aspect makes her over-fond:
So, to preclude fresh sin, he tries rosbif.
Meantime the husband is no more abused:
Auguste forgives her ere the tear is used.
Then hangeth all on one tremendous IF:--
If she will choose between them. She does choose;
And takes her husband, like a proper wife.
Unnatural? My dear, these things are life:
And life, some think, is worthy of the Muse.
Love ere he bleeds, an eagle in high skies,
Has earth beneath his wings: from reddened eve
He views the rosy dawn. In vain they weave
The fatal web below while far he flies.
But when the arrow strikes him, there's a change.
He moves but in the track of his spent pain,
Whose red drops are the links of a harsh chain,
Binding him to the ground, with narrow range.
A subtle serpent then has Love become.
I had the eagle in my bosom erst:
Henceforward with the serpent I am cursed.
I can interpret where the mouth is dumb.
Speak, and I see the side-lie of a truth.
Perchance my heart may pardon you this deed:
But be no coward:--you that made Love bleed,
You must bear all the venom of his tooth!
Distraction is the panacea, Sir!
I hear my oracle of Medicine say.
Doctor! that same specific yesterday
I tried, and the result will not deter
A second trial. Is the devil's line
Of golden hair, or raven black, composed?
And does a cheek, like any sea-shell rosed,
Or clear as widowed sky, seem most divine?
No matter, so I taste forgetfulness.
And if the devil snare me, body and mind,
Here gratefully I score:--he seemèd kind,
When not a soul would comfort my distress!
O sweet new world, in which I rise new made!
O Lady, once I gave love: now I take!
Lady, I must be flattered. Shouldst thou wake
The passion of a demon, be not afraid.
I must be flattered. The imperious
Desire speaks out. Lady, I am content
To play with you the game of Sentiment,
And with you enter on paths perilous;
But if across your beauty I throw light,
To make it threefold, it must be all mine.
First secret; then avowed. For I must shine
Envied,--I, lessened in my proper sight!
Be watchful of your beauty, Lady dear!
How much hangs on that lamp you cannot tell.
Most earnestly I pray you, tend it well:
And men shall see me as a burning sphere;
And men shall mark you eyeing me, and groan
To be the God of such a grand sunflower!
I feel the promptings of Satanic power,
While you do homage unto me alone.
Am I failing ? For no longer can I cast
A glory round about this head of gold.
Glory she wears, but springing from the mould;
Not like the consecration of the Past!
Is my soul beggared? Something more than earth
I cry for still: I cannot be at peace
In having Love upon a' mortal lease.
I cannot take the woman at her worth!
Where is the ancient wealth wherewith I clothed
Our human nakedness, and could endow
With spiritual splendour a white brow
That else had grinned at me the fact I loathed ?
A kiss is but a kiss now! and no wave
Of a great flood that whirls me to the sea.
But, as you will! we'll sit contentedly,
And eat our pot of honey on the grave.
What are we first ? First, animals; and next
Intelligences at a leap; on whom
Pale lies the distant shadow of the tomb,
And all that draweth on the tomb for text.
Into which state comes Love, the crowning sun:
Beneath whose light the shadow loses form.
We are the lords of life, and life is warm.
Intelligence and instinct now are one.
But nature says: 'My children most they seem
When they least know me: therefore I decree
That they shall suffer.' Swift doth young Love flee,
And we stand wakened, shivering from our dream.
Then if we study Nature we are wise.
Thus do the few who live but with the day:
The scientific animals are they.
Lady, this is my sonnet to your eyes.
This golden head has wit in it. I live
Again, and a far higher life, near her.
Some women like a young philosopher;
Perchance because he is diminutive.
For woman's manly god must not exceed
Proportions of the natural nursing size.
Great poets and great sages draw no prize
With women: but the little lap-dog breed,
Who can be hugged, or on a mantel-piece
Perched up for adoration, these obtain
Her homage. And of this we men are vain?
Of this! 'Tis ordered for the world's increase
Small flattery! Yet she has that rare gift
To beauty, Common Sense. I am approved.
It is not half so nice as being loved,
And yet I do prefer it. What's my drift?
Full faith I have she holds that rarest gift
To beauty, Common Sense. To see her lie
With her fair visage an inverted sky
Bloom-covered, while the underlids uplift,
Would almost wreck the faith; but when her mouth
(Can it kiss sweetly? sweetly!) would address
The inner me that thirsts for her no less,
And has so long been languishing in drouth,
I feel that I am matched; that I am man!
One restless corner of my heart or head,
That holds a dying something never dead,
Still frets, though Nature giveth all she can.
It means, that woman is not, I opine,
Her sex's antidote. Who seeks the asp
For serpent's bites? 'Twould calm me could I clasp
Shrieking Bacchantes with their souls of wine!
'In Paris, at the Louvre, there have I seen
The sumptuously-feathered angel pierce
Prone Lucifer, descending. Looked he fierce,
Showing the fight a fair one? Too serene!
The young Pharsalians did not disarray
Less willingly their locks of floating silk:
That suckling mouth of his, upon the milk
Of heaven might still be feasting through the fray.
Oh, Raphael! when men the Fiend do fight,
They conquer not upon such easy terms.
Half serpent in the struggle grow these worms
And does he grow half human, all is right.'
This to my Lady in a distant spot,
Upon the theme: While mind is mastering clay,
Gross clay invades it. If the spy you play,
My wife, read this! Strange love talk, is it not?
Madam would speak with me. So, now it comes:
The Deluge or else Fire! She's well; she thanks
My husbandship. Our chain on silence clanks.
Time leers between, above his twiddling thumbs.
Am I quite well? Most excellent in health!
The journals, too, I diligently peruse.
Vesuvius is expected to give news:
Niagara is no noisier. By stealth
Our eyes dart scrutinizing snakes. She's glad
I'm happy, says her quivering under-lip.
'And are not you ?' 'How can I be ?' 'Take ship!
For happiness is somewhere to be had.'
'Nowhere for me!' Her voice is barely heard.
I am not melted, and make no pretence.
With commonplace I freeze her, tongue and sense.
Niagara or Vesuvius is deferred.
It is no vulgar nature I have wived.
Secretive, sensitive, she takes a wound
Deep to her soul, as if the sense had swooned,
And not a thought of vengeance had survived.
No confidences has she: but relief
Must come to one whose suffering is acute.
O have a care of natures that are mute!
They punish you in acts: their steps are brief.
What is she doing? What does she demand
From Providence or me? She is not one
Long to endure this torpidly, and shun
The drugs that crowd about a woman's hand.
At Forfeits during snow we played, and I
Must kiss her. 'Well performed!' I said: then she:
''Tis hardly worth the money, you agree?'
Save her? What for? To act this wedded lie!
My Lady unto Madam makes her bow.
The charm of women is, that even while
You're probed by them for tears, you yet may smile,
Nay, laugh outright, as I have done just now.
The interview was gracious: they anoint
(To me aside) each other with fine praise:
Discriminating compliments they raise,
That hit with wondrous aim on the weak point:
My Lady's nose of Nature might complain.
It is not fashioned aptly to express
Her character of large-browed steadfastness.
But Madam says: Thereof she may be vain!
Now, Madam's faulty feature is a glazed
And inaccessible eye, that has soft fires,
Wide gates, at love-time only. This admires
My Lady. At the two I stand amazed.
Along the garden terrace, under which
A purple valley (lighted at its edge
By smoky torch-flame on the long cloud-ledge
Whereunder dropped the chariot), glimmers rich,
A quiet company we pace, and wait
The dinner-bell in prae-digestive calm.
So sweet up violet banks the Southern balm
Breathes round, we care not if the bell be late:
Though here and there grey seniors question Time
In irritable coughings. With slow foot
The low rosed moon, the face of Music mute,
Begins among her silent bars to climb.
As in and out, in silvery dusk, we thread,
I hear the laugh of Madam, and discern
My Lady's heel before me at each turn.
Our tragedy, is it alive or dead?
Give to imagination some pure light
In human form to fix it, or you shame
The devils with that hideous human game:
Imagination urging appetite!
Thus fallen have earth's greatest Gogmagogs,
Who dazzle us, whom we can not revere:
Imagination is the charioteer
That, in default of better, drives the hogs.
So, therefore, my dear Lady, let me love!
My soul is arrowy to the light in you.
You know me that I never can renew
The bond that woman broke: what would you have?
'Tis Love, or Vileness! not a choice between,
Save petrifaction! What does Pity here?
She killed a thing, and now it's dead, 'tis dear.
Oh, when you counsel me, think what you mean!
She yields: my Lady in her noblest mood
Has yielded: she, my golden-crownèd rose!
The bride of every sense! more sweet than those
Who breathe the violet breath of maidenhood.
O visage of still music in the sky
Soft moon! I feel thy song, my fairest friend!
True harmony within can apprehend
Dumb harmony without. And hark! 'tis nigh!
Belief has struck the note of sound: a gleam
Of living silver shows me where she shook
Her long white fingers down the shadowy brook,
That sings her song, half waking, half in dream.
What two come here to mar this heavenly tune ?
A man is one: the woman bears my name,
And honour. Their hands touch! Am I still tame?
God, what a dancing spectre seems the moon!
I bade my Lady think what she might mean.
Know I my meaning, I? Can I love one,
And yet be jealous of another? None
Commits such folly. Terrible Love, I ween,
Has might, even dead, half sighing to upheave
The lightless seas of selfishness amain:
Seas that in a man's heart have no rain
To fall and still them. Peace can I achieve,
By turning to this fountain-source of woe,
This woman, who's to Love as fire to wood?
She breathed the violet breath of maidenhood
Against my kisses once! but I say, No!
The thing is mocked at! Helplessly afloat,
I know not what I do, whereto I strive,
The dread that my old love may be alive,
Has seized my nursling new love by the throat.
How many a thing which we cast to the ground,
When others pick it up becomes a gem!
We grasp at all the wealth it is to them;
And by reflected light its worth is found.
Yet for us still 'tis nothing! and that zeal
Of false appreciation quickly fades.
This truth is little known to human shades,
How rare from their own instinct 'tis to feel!
They waste the soul with spurious desire,
That is not the ripe flame upon the bough.
We two have taken up a lifeless vow
To rob a living passion: dust for fire!
Madam is grave, and eyes the clock that tells
Approaching midnight. We have struck despair
Into two hearts. O, look we like a pair
Who for fresh nuptials joyfully yield all else?
I am to follow her. There is much grace
In woman when thus bent on martyrdom.
They think that dignity of soul may come,
Perchance, with dignity of body. Base!
But I was taken by that air of cold
And statuesque sedateness, when she said
'I'm going'; lit a taper, bowed her head,
And went, as with the stride of Pallas bold.
Fleshly indifference horrible! The hands
Of Time now signal: O, she's safe from me!
Within those secret walls what do I see
Where first she set the taper down she stands:
Not Pallas: Hebe shamed! Thoughts black as death,
Like a stirred pool in sunshine break. Her wrists
I catch: she faltering, as she half resists,
'You love. . . ? love. . . ? love. . . ?' all on an in-drawn breath.
Mark where the pressing wind shoots javelin-like,
Its skeleton shadow on the broad-backed wave!
Here is a fitting spot to dig Love's grave;
Here where the ponderous breakers plunge and strike,
And dart their hissing tongues high up the sand:
In hearing of the ocean, and in sight
Of those ribbed wind-streaks running into white.
If I the death of Love had deeply planned,
I never could have made it half so sure,
As by the unblest kisses which upbraid
The full-waked sense; or failing that, degrade!
'Tis morning: but no morning can restore
What we have forfeited. I see no sin:
The wrong is mixed. In tragic life, God wot,
No villain need be! Passions spin the plot:
We are betrayed by what is false within.
They say, that Pity in Love's service dwells,
A porter at the rosy temple's gate.
I missed him going: but it is my fate
To come upon him now beside his wells;
Whereby I know that I Love's temple leave,
And that the purple doors have closed behind.
Poor soul! if in those early days unkind,
Thy power to sting had been but power to grieve,
We now might with an equal spirit meet,
And not be matched like innocence and vice.
She for the Temple's worship has paid price,
And takes the coin of Pity as a cheat.
She sees through simulation to the bone:
What's best in her impels her to the worst:
Never, she cries, shall Pity soothe Love's thirst,
Or foul hypocrisy for truth atone
It is the season of the sweet wild rose,
My Lady's emblem in the heart of me!
So golden-crownèd shines she gloriously,
And with that softest dream of blood she glows:
Mild as an evening heaven round Hesper bright!
I pluck the flower, and smell it, and revive
The time when in her eyes I stood alive.
I seem to look upon it out of Night.
Here's Madam, stepping hastily. Her whims
Bid her demand the flower, which I let drop.
As I proceed, I feel her sharply stop,
And crush it under heel with trembling limbs.
She joins me in a cat-like way, and talks
Of company, and even condescends
To utter laughing scandal of old friends.
These are the summer days, and these our walks.
At last we parley: we so strangely dumb
In such a close communion! It befell
About the sounding of the Matin-bell,
And lo! her place was vacant, and the hum
Of loneliness was round me. Then I rose,
And my disordered brain did guide my foot
To that old wood where our first love-salute
Was interchanged: the source of many throes!
There did I see her, not alone. I moved
Toward her, and made proffer of my arm.
She took it simply, with no rude alarm;
And that disturbing shadow passed reproved.
I felt the pained speech coming, and declared
My firm belief in her, ere she could speak.
A ghastly morning came into her cheek,
While with a widening soul on me she stared.
We saw the swallows gathering in the sky,
And in the osier-isle we heard them noise.
We had not to look back on summer joys,
Or forward to a summer of bright dye:
But in the largeness of the evening earth
Our spirits grew as we went side by side.
The hour became her husband and my bride.
Love that had robbed us so, thus blessed our dearth!
The pilgrims of the year waxed very loud
In multitudinous chatterings, as the flood
Full brown came from the West, and like pale blood
Expanded to the upper crimson cloud.
Love that had robbed us of immortal things,
This little moment mercifully gave,
Where I have seen across the twilight wave
The swan sail with her young beneath her wings.
Their sense is with their senses all mixed in,
Destroyed by subleties these women are!
More brain, O Lord, more brain! or we shall mar
Utterly this fair garden we might win.
Behold! I looked for peace, and thought it near.
Our inmost hearts had opened, each to each.
We drank the pure daylight of honest speech.
Alas I that was the fatal draught, I fear.
For when of my lost Lady came the word,
This woman, O this agony of flesh!
Jealous devotion bade her break the mesh,
That I might seek that other like a bird.
I do adore the nobleness! despise
The act! She has gone forth, I know not where.
Will the hard world my sentience of her share?
I feel the truth; so let the world surmise.
He found her by the ocean's moaning verge,
Nor any wicked change in her discerned;
And she believed his old love had returned,
Which was her exultation, and her scourge.
She took his hand, and walked with him, and seemed
The wife he sought, though shadow-like and dry.
She had one terror, lest her heart should sigh,
And tell her loudly she no longer dreamed.
She dared not say, 'This is my breast: look in.'
But there's a strength to help the desperate weak.
That night he learned how silence best can speak
The awful things when Pity pleads for Sin.
About the middle of the night her call
Was heard, and he came wondering to the bed.
'Now kiss me, dear! it may be, now!' she said.
Lethe had passed those lips, and he knew all.
Thus piteously Love closed what he begat:
The union of this ever-diverse pair!
These two were rapid falcons in a snare,
Condemned to do the flitting of the bat.
Lovers beneath the singing sky of May,
They wandered once; clear as the dew on flowers:
But they fed not on the advancing hours:
Their hearts held cravings for the buried day.
Then each applied to each that fatal knife,
Deep questioning, which probes to endless dole.
Ah, what a dusty answer gets the soul
When hot for certainties in this our life!
In tragic hints here see what evermore
Moves dark as yonder midnight ocean's force,
Thundering like ramping hosts of warrior horse,
To throw that fain thin line upon the shore!
In the name of Love, I swear that I would rather hear Heliodora's whisper in my ear than the shining harp of Apollo.
The moon is down, and the Pleiades.
It's midnight, time passes, and I lie alone.
I will plait white violets, myrtle, and soft narcissus too.
I will twine laughing lilies and sweet crocus, purple hyacinths, and the roses lovers cherish, so the wreath I set on lovely Heliodora's brow will scatter petals on her scented hair.
Hello there, rose girl, you have a rosy charm.
But what are you selling? Yourself? Your roses? Both? Wine is the test for love: Nikagoras told us he loved no one, but his many toasts betrayed him.
Oh yes! He bent his head and wept, and then his wreath slipped, half to cover the aching in those sad dark eyes.
If my kiss offends you then punish me with yours.
If someone's with her, I'll go, but if she's sleeping alone then for God's sake give me just a moment inside.
Tell her I'm drunk, that I've made my way past thugs and thieves to her door.
Tell her reckless Love was my guide.
Tossing, turning, back and forth, all night long on your empty bed.
Poor Krinagoras: you'll get no sleep till lovely Gemella lies by your side.
Don't try to bend a stubborn heart.
When you were a green grape you refused me.
When you were ripe in the bunch you sent me away.
Give me, at least, a bite of your raisin.
This tomb holds Archeanassa, the courtesan from Kolophon whose very wrinkles were graced by sweet Love.
Oh you lovers who gathered the fresh blossoms of her youth, what a fire you passed through! Melite, you have Hera's eyes, Athena's hands, Aphrodite's breasts and Thetis' feet.
Happy is the man who sees you, thrice-blessed is he who hears your voice, the one who kisses you finds paradise and he who marries you is a god.
Sweet for the thirsty is a drink of snow in summer, and sweet for sailors to run before spring breezes at winter's end.
But sweeter still is the single cloak that hides two lovers as they honor Aphrodite.
There is more to love than finding someone beautiful to please your critical eye.
This is love, this is fire: delighting in someone less than lovely and adoring her with a heart aflame.
Anyone can like a pretty face.
I'm a nobody, no one special, a nothing yet even I am loved.
Even I am the master of someone else's soul.
If hating is pain and loving is pain, then of these two bitter agonies give me the one that's bittersweet.
I love everything about you everything but that wandering eye of yours, so fond of the most vile of men.
Such was my passion for love that it twisted itself beneath my heart and spread thick mist across my eyes, stealing my tender wits away.
Melissa, you're the image of your namesake, the flower-loving honeybee.
I know this woman, and I take it to heart.
You kiss me, and your lips are honey.
You ask for money, and I am stung.
Doris drew a single strand from her golden hair and bound my hands, making me her prisoner.
At first I laughed, thinking I would easily shake off the lovely girl's ties, but when I had no strength to break them I groaned, like one held fast by brazen bonds.
And now, the most miserable of men, I hang on a hair, following my mistress wherever she wishes to drag me.
Delectable Theano came to stay with me, but she wept bitter tears all night long and cursed the rising evening star for pointing to the coming dawn.
We mortals are never satisfied.
We lovers must have dawnless nights.
Oh moody morning star, why have you chosen this, of all nights, to dawdle in your great spin around the world? Why tonight, when another lies warm and snug beneath my Demo's cloak? And why, when my slender love lay with me, did you come so soon to bring the light and laugh to end our tender night? Seeing Prodike alone and happy, I clasped her sweet knees and begged: Save a man who's nearly lost! Let me have what little life I've got! She wept as I spoke, but then she wiped away her tears and with gentle hands pushed me away.
Love shook my heart like wind pounding mountain oaks.
My wine cup's laughing, giggling, slipped between the sweet sipping lips of Zenophila, the girl who loves to love.
Lucky cup! If only she would bring her mouth to mine and with one breath drink down my very soul.
Tender Asklepias has clear blue eyes, gentle seas inviting us to set sail for love.
Here, Rhodoklea, is a garland, blossoms laced by my own hands.
Here are lilies and roses, moist anemones, soft narcissus and dark-gleaming violets.
Wear them, and cease to be vain.
Your beauty, like theirs, will fade.
Let's you and me jump into the bath together, Prodike.
We'll crown ourselves with garlands and drink our fill of unmixed wine.
Our time for rejoicing is short: soon we're old, then we're dead.
Why are you sighing? I'm in love.
With whom? A girl.
Is she pretty? Oh yes! Where did you meet her? At a dinner party.
Do you think you have a chance with her? I know I do, friend, but I want it kept secret.
Ah, so you don't plan to marry her? No, I've learned she's penniless.
What? Liar! You don't love her! How can a heart in love make calculations? Xanthippe's touch upon the lyre, her playful speech, her inviting eyes, her singing and the fire they have set will burn you.
Why and when and how I cannot say, but they will, poor heart, they will.
A girl kissed me in the early evening with wet lips.
Her kiss was nectar, her mouth divine.
And now I am drunk with the kiss, for I have drunk deeply of love.
Hardhearted Eros, if you burn my little soul too often she will fly away.
She has wings too.
She who sets whole towns on fire, Sthenelais, the high-priced girl who pours herself like gold over those with coin to buy her, lay naked beside me all last night, giving me all I wanted and more (and for free!) till dawn came and the end of my dream.
Never again will I grovel before her cruel beauty, nor sit and weep alone, for now I find my pleasure in sensual sleep.
Rufinus I've armed myself with Logic against Love, and if it's one on one he doesn't have a chance: I, a mortal, will stand against a god! But if he has Bacchus on his side it's two against one, and I won't have a prayer.
Diophanes of Myrina Eros is like a thief: sharp-eyed, bold, he robs us blind.
Meleagros Eros, still a babe in his mother's lap, played at dice one morning and tossed away my soul.
Meleagros This Love I have inside me is fond of playing ball, and to you, Heliodora, he throws my trembling heart, saying, ''catch!" Please play with him, Heliodora, and don't drop me; he has no patience with those who break the rules.
Palladas of Alexandria Lamplight only darkens the night of a man cursed with an ugly wife.
I send you sweet perfume, but more for its pleasure than for yours: you perfume perfume.
Anonymous Plato My soul was on my lips while I was kissing Agathon.
Wild thing! She came there hoping to sneak across to him.
Meleagros Give her my message, Dorkas.
Pay attention! Be sure to repeat it twice, no, three times.
Yes, Dorkas, the whole thing! All right, get going hurry! Hey Dorkas, wait.
Wait a second! Stop! Where are you going, Dorkas? I haven't finished yet; there's something else that .
(I'm such an idiot!) never mind, don't say anything at all.
No wait, tell her everything.
Dorkas, why am I sending you, anyway? Look, I'm going with you, I mean, step aside, Dorkas, I'll lead the way.
Meleagros Cupbearer! Fill our cups, and with each ladle say again and again "to Heliodora!" till the wine's mixed with her name, and crown me with the wreath she wore last night, a scented memory of her.
But look! The rose is weeping, for it knows tonight she's sleeping in someone's else's arms.
Plato You're my Star, a stargazer too, and I wish that I were Heaven, with a billion eyes to look at you! Philodemos I want no more white violets and lyre-song, no more Chian wines and Syrian myrrh, no more carousing and drunken whores I hate them all, they're driving me mad.
But wreathe me in narcissus and let me taste the cross flute, rub me down with saffron balm, moisten my tongue with wine from Mytilene and wed me to a hearth-and-home girl.
Philodemos Oh feet, Oh legs, Oh thighs I die for, Oh bottom, Oh mound, Oh flanks, Oh shoulders, Oh breasts, Oh slender neck, Oh hands, Oh eyes that drive me mad, Oh skillful moves, Oh exquisite tongue, Oh inspiring moans.
Yes, her name is Flora and she is Italian.
And no, she cannot sing Sappho's Greek.
Yet Perseus loved Andromeda, and she was Indian! Meleagros Timarion's kisses sting, his eyes are fire, his glances sear, his touch inspires.
Meleagros Even winged Eros himself is stricken (and in midair!) a victim of your eyes, Timarion.
Anakreon Look! Climbing this steep white crag I turn and leap (drunk with love) into the foaming surf below.
 Meleagros Heavy-laden ocean ships cruising down the Hellespont, sails full of the good North Wind, if you should see Phanion on the beach at Kos gazing out upon the blue sea tell her that love carries me there, though not on shipboard, but by land.
Tell her, good ships, and Zeus will breathe the fair wind of his affection into your broad sails.
Meleagros Shrill mosquitoes, shameless bloodsuckers, winged monsters of the night, please, I beg you: let my Zenophila sleep a while in peace, and come gorge yourselves on me instead.
But what's the use of begging? Even you relentless insects delight in the soft warmth of her body.
Still, I'm warning you, you nasty bugs: either stop your biting or you will feel the smack of my jealous hands.
Paulus Silentiarius They say a man bitten by a mad dog sees the beast's image reflected on the water.
I wonder: did Eros, rabid, sink his bitter fangs in me? I see you in the ocean deep, the swirling stream and the wine cup.
Anakreon I love, and I do not love.
I am mad, and I am not mad.
Antiphilos Hey beautiful! Wait up! What's your name, honey? When Can I see you again? We'll do whatever you like.
Hey, don't you speak? Where do you live? I've have a slave see you home.
You're not attached, are you? Not talking? Well, goodbye then, you stuck-up girl.
Won't you even say goodbye? It doesn't matter, I'll be back.
I know how to soften a heart like yours.
But for now, baby, goodbye.
Marcus Argentarius You had love, Sosikrates, when you had money, but now that you are poor it seems there's no love left for you.
What a cure for love is poverty! Even Menophila, who used to call you her cutie and her darling Adonis, now asks who you are and where you're from.
I guess you've had to learn the meaning of that old saying: ''The man who has nothing has nobody for a friend." Palladas of Alexandria Zenon, war has broken out in your house because you married the daughter of Protomachos (first in a fight) and Nikomache (victorious in a fight).
What you need is a helpful adulterer, a Lysimachos (deliverer from a fight) who will take pity on you and deliver you from Andromache (man-fighter), the daughter of Protomachos.
 Meleagros It must have been Eros himself who sharpened Heliodora's fingernail; even her gentlest love-scratching pierces my heart.
 Asklepiades The night is long and wintry.
The Pleiades glimmer in the chilling dark.
Back and forth before her door I pass, soaking wet with rain and tormented by desire for her the cheater.
This can't be love! No! Aphrodite has shot me instead with agony, a burning dart straight from the fire.
 Sappho You came, and I was longing for you.
You cooled a heart that burned with desire.
  Asklepiades Didyme waved a twig at me and I was swept away.
Even now, gazing upon her beauty, I melt like wax before the fire.
Yes, her skin is dark and foreign, but what is that to me? The coals, too, are dark, but when we light them they shine as brightly as roses.
 Poseidippos Don't think you can fool me with those crocodile tears, Philainis.
I know the truth: As long as you're lying beside me you say there's no one you love more, but if you were with someone else you'd say you loved him more than me.
 Leontios Oh cup, touch her honeyed lips.
Taste them while you have the chance.
And know I don't begrudge your pleasure, I only wish I had your luck.
  I wish I were the wind, and that you, walking on the shore, would bare your breasts and take me to them as I blow.
Anonymous  Rufinus The silver-toed girl was bathing, letting the water splash and play upon the golden apples of her breasts, skin silky smooth as milk.
The round cheeks of her bottom gently rolled and tossed together as she turned and moved, flesh more fluid than the water that coursed down to where her fingers spread to cover the swelling flow not all of it, but as much as she could.
 Krinagoras Roses used to bloom in springtime, but now in deepest winter we burst into scarlet, smiling on your birthday morn and soon your wedding day as well.
Better to crown the loveliest of women than to wait for spring and sun.
 Rufinus Europa's kiss would be sweet resting lightly on the lips, the faintest touch upon the mouth.
But more, much more than this: she presses close and hard and pulls the soul up from my fingertips.
 Macedonius Every year the harvesters gather in the vintage, and not one frowns on the vines' curling tendrils.
I too am a harvester, holding rosy-armed you entwined in the supple knot of my embrace and gathering in the vintage of love.
No better summer, no other spring could ever be, for it's now that you are young and full of every joy, and I pray that you will stay this way forever.
But if some wrinkle like a tendril comes creeping, I will scarcely blink, because I love you.
  Marcus Argentarius Diokleia, you'll see, is thin, a skinny Aphrodite, though she has the most delightful ways.
Then not much will come between us.
I'll fall upon her little chest and lie as close as may be to her soul.
 I fell for her, I kissed her, I was lucky, I am loved.
But who I am, and who she is, and how it happened, God only knows.
Anonymous   Here, beneath this stone, I lie, the famous women who shed her clothes for only one man.
Anonymous  Sappho I feel like a god, sitting so close to you, listening intently to your gentle voice and sweet laughter.
I hear you, and my heart trembles in my breast.
I see you, and I can no longer speak; my tongue has snapped, and a thin quick fire runs beneath my skin.
My eyes are empty, my ears hum, and I am covered with sweat.
I shiver, pale as summer grass, and feel myself slip close to the edge of death.
 Sappho Happy bridegroom! The wedding you hoped for has happened; the maiden you prayed for is yours!  Archilochos All I want is to touch Neoboule's hand.
 Palladas of Alexandria A grammarian's daughter made love with a man and bore a child masculine, feminine, and neuter.
 Sappho Some say a host of horsemen, others a troop of infantry, others still a fleet of ships is the fairest sight on the dark earth.
But I say it is the one you love.
And this is easily proved, for Helen, the most beautiful of women, sailed off to Troy without a thought for her child and kin, thinking of her beloved alone.
I think of Anaktoria, who is far away, for I would rather see her gentle step and the glad radiance of her face than all the chariots and armed men of Lydia.
 Lucilius Eutychos the painter produced twenty sons and never got a single likeness.
 Meleagros Marathonis laid Nikopolis in this stone tomb, wetting the marble with tears that fell in vain: Only sorrow remains when a man's wife is gone.
 Meleagros My soul warns me to run from Heliodora, the cause of my past hurts and tears.
She begs me to flee, but I cannot bring myself to leave.
The shameless girl herself says I should go, but all the while she covers me with kisses.
 Rufinus I used to pray, Thalia, for the night when you would come and I would satisfy my longing with armfuls of luscious you.
And now you are here, naked and willing beside me, but I am loose and limp with sleep.
Wake up, body! How can you do this to me? I may never have this chance again!  Agathias Anxious to learn if fair-eyed Ereutho really loved me, I tested her heart with a clever ploy: ''I'm leaving," I said, "for a far-off land, but you must stay behind, my darling, faithful to me and our love until at last I return." Then, crying out, she leaped up, struck her face with her fists, tore her curls, and begged me stay until, like one not easily persuaded, and with a disappointed look, I gave in to her.
Now I am happy in my love, for I have the thing I most wanted, and by granting it as a favor too!  Sappho You make me burn.
That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and loves not the common people.
Faith, there had been many great men that have flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there be many that they have loved, they know not wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly see't.
I love them as they weigh.
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
Translate his malice towards you into love.
